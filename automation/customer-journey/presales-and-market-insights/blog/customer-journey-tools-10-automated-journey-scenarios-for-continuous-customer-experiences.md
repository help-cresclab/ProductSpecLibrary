With a [**customer journey**](https://blog.cresclab.com/tw/customerjourney?hsLang=zh-tw), brands can better understand customer experience, behaviors, and touchpoints.

In digital marketing, you can also use MarTech tools to build an **automated customer journey**.

This lets you act on data, run marketing automation, and visualize the journey as a [**Customer Journey Map**](https://blog.cresclab.com/tw/cjm/?hsLang=zh-tw).

Crescendo Lab MAAC Automated Journeys are built for exactly this.

This article explains what automated journeys are and shares 10 practical scenarios you can reuse.

### What is an automated customer journey

An **automated customer journey** combines customer journey thinking with a [marketing automation](https://blog.cresclab.com/tw/marketing-automation-introduction/?hsLang=zh-tw) tool.

It lets you design a messaging “script”.

Messages are sent based on audience segments, triggers, and time delays.

Typical channels include LINE Official Account and SMS.

In the era of [**first-party data**](https://blog.cresclab.com/tw/first-party-data/?hsLang=zh-tw), automated journeys can track data from LINE, GA4, and your eCommerce site.

With AI features, you can also predict intent and recommend products.

The goal is simple: send the right content to the right person at the right time.

Automation also saves significant time and operational cost.

Here is what it looks like to build an automated journey in Crescendo Lab MAAC:\

### Why use automated journeys

*   Improve operational efficiency\
    Automated journeys remove manual messaging work. Examples include visit reminders and post-purchase surveys.

    They track performance in real time.

    You can branch to the next step based on behavior. One common signal is message opens.

    With AI marketing tools, you can also automate segmentation. You can optimize send time. You can generate product recommendations.\

    ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/智慧發送自動旅程 Oct 13 2023 09 20 24 9531 AM.png>)
*   Build a personalized experience\
    Connect data sources into MAAC. Common integrations include LINE OA + GA, eCommerce platforms, CRM, and CDP.

    Use tags, customer attributes, and AI tooling to personalize each step. You can also auto-apply tags at each stage.

    Personalization improves retention and loyalty.
*   Support many use cases\
    Like Customer Journey Maps, automated journeys need clear goals and scope.

    You can design journeys for many outcomes. Examples include onboarding new LINE friends to reduce blocks. Another example is cart abandonment recovery to raise conversion.
*   Cover multiple touchpoints in one flow\
    Cross-channel automation helps you orchestrate a consistent experience across touchpoints. Example:

    * A customer browses a specific product on your site.
    * Your LINE OA sends a coupon.
    * The customer adds the item to cart.
    * LINE OA reminds them to check out.
    * After purchase, LINE OA sends order and shipping updates.
    * If the message is not opened, send an SMS fallback.
    * 30 days later, LINE OA sends a satisfaction survey.
    * After completion, the customer gets an in-store coupon.
    * 5 days later, LINE and SMS remind them to use it.

    This single journey spans website, LINE, SMS, and offline store touchpoints.\

### 10 automated journey scenarios for LINE marketing

Start building your own automated journeys.

Using [LINE marketing](https://blog.cresclab.com/tw/line-oa-marketing-guide/?hsLang=zh-tw) as an example, here are 10 journey scenarios for LINE Official Account:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### New friend check-in tasks to reduce blocks

* Best for journey stage: Awareness

New friends blocking right after adding your account is painful.

Use an automated journey to build a check-in mechanism. Offer a coupon to encourage repeat engagement.

Example: the finance brand _zingala_ highlighted “Get shopping credit after one week” in the welcome message. They also used a “new friend gift” tag to trigger the journey. Combine it with keyword auto-replies to collect more customer tags. ([Full case study](https://www.cresclab.com/tw/success-story/zingala))

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Collect data with satisfaction surveys

* Best for journey stage: Retention

After a purchase, store experience, course/event, or app download, send a survey.

Use it to measure satisfaction and capture preferences. Then tag respondents for future targeting.

With MAAC auto-tagging, survey results can directly trigger journeys. MAAC also integrates with [SurveyCake](https://www.cresclab.com/tw/solution/data-integration). It can tag users based on answers.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/解決方案 數據 線上問卷 Oct 13 2023 09 20 11 5613 AM.png>)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Build an interaction script for a campaign

* Best for journey stage: Depends on the campaign target

For seasonal promos, you can use a [LINE game module](https://www.cresclab.com/tw/solution/engagement) to boost engagement. You can also pair it with an automated journey to pre-write a full campaign script.

Example: _zingala_ designed a 3-week birthday campaign with three waves. Each week had a different theme. They ended with a prize draw to drive survey completion.

Example script ideas:

* Cross-channel traffic to FB / IG / YouTube campaign content or tasks
* Keyword auto-replies to collect preferences
* Game modules with rewards
* Receipt/invoice modules to incentivize uploads for prize draws
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Drive OMO traffic and repeat store visits

* Best for journey stage: Retention, Advocacy

Automated journeys are practical for OMO strategies.

When a customer visits a store via a tracking link, [LINE Beacon](https://blog.cresclab.com/tw/media-martech-with-line-beacon/?hsLang=zh-tw), or invoice upload, they can receive a “store visit” tag.

After N days, automatically send an in-store coupon to drive return visits.

For some industries, you can also schedule recurring reminders for maintenance, service sessions, or classes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Replenishment reminders (repeat purchase)

* Best for journey stage: Retention, Advocacy

After a purchase, use product tags to trigger an automated journey. Send a reminder when the product is likely running out.

Add a coupon to increase conversion.

This works especially well for consumables like household items, skincare, supplements, pet food, and cleaning products.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Coupon expiry reminders

* Best for journey stage: Consideration, Retention

When customers claim a coupon or points, tag them immediately. Use that tag to trigger a journey.

Send reminders before expiry to drive purchases. This pairs well with replenishment and store-visit strategies.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Track web behavior and send coupons to drive conversion

* Best for journey stage: Consideration

By integrating Crescendo Lab MAAC with your website analytics (GA) via API, you can track web behavior.

When a customer views a specific page, trigger an automated journey. Send a coupon or a tailored marketing message in LINE OA to nudge purchase.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/瀏覽網頁自動旅程 發送優惠券 Oct 13 2023 09 20 12 4902 AM.png>)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Cart abandonment recovery (remarketing)

* Best for journey stage: Consideration

Cart abandonment is a common break in the journey. Automated journeys help you recover it.

When a customer adds to cart, MAAC Automated Journeys can work with cart remarketing to remind checkout.

Example: the lifestyle brand _Howday_ achieved a 565% ROAS with cart remarketing. ([Full case study](https://www.cresclab.com/tw/success-story/howday))

MAAC can also detect whether the customer purchased. If they still haven’t bought, you can send a coupon as a final push. This keeps your brand present at each stage with context-relevant messaging.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/購物車再行銷 Oct 13 2023 09 20 17 8653 AM.jpg>)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### AI product recommendations

* Best for journey stage: Consideration, Retention, Advocacy

With MAAC product recommendation messages, automated journeys become much more powerful.

You can auto-select high-intent audiences or loyal customers and recommend best sellers every month. You can also detect browsing or purchase behavior and let AI recommend relevant products automatically.

Example: the large eCommerce platform _GOMAJI_ saw an 80%+ click rate within 3 days and increased orders. ([Full case study](https://www.cresclab.com/tw/success-story/gomaji))

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/商品推薦訊息自動旅程 Oct 13 2023 09 20 09 2132 AM.png>)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Personalized care messages

* Best for journey stage: Retention, Advocacy

After a customer purchases a product/service or completes a tagged survey, start an automated journey. Send personalized content monthly.

Examples include pregnancy month-by-month tips or recurring mental health check-ins.

You can also identify dormant customers (e.g., no purchase in 60 days). Offer a loyal-customer incentive to re-engage and drive repeat purchase.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Conclusion

Customer journeys are not just for analysis and planning.

You can proactively design smooth, personalized, and efficient interactions to build stronger customer relationships. Over time, customers become loyal members.
