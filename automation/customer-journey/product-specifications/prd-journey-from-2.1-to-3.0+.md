### 2. Release notes

* \*\*v2.1:\*\*Helps marketers optimize their automated flows with node-level performance tracking. It unlocks basic needs before entering the future journey phase.
* **v2.2**: to be update

### 3. Goal (v3.0)

Customer Value

* **Handle More Marketing Scenarios**: Easily **implement a wider range of campaigns** and customer communications.
* **Save Time with Automation**: **Reduce manual work** by **automating key marketing communications**.
* **Smarter Marketing with AI**: Future AI helps **work more efficiently** and achieve **better results at a lower cost**.

Business Value

* **Win More Deals**: Attract clients and **capture MA budgets** with multi-channel/AI features, creating **upsell opportunities**.
* **Prevent Churn**: Make MAAC essential with top automation and results, **increasing stickiness** to **prevent churn**.
* **Secure Future with AI**: AI automation offers a unique value for **upselling** and our market leadership.

### 4. Background

* Our current journey feature has not improved for a while, and many users have asked for updates (see [Appendix1- Requirement Analysis](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_wz1xf04lqsfs)).
* Most competitors (e.g. Omnichat, Omnisegment, BotBonnie) already offer **multi-channel marketing automation**, and this is now a basic industry standard. If we don’t catch up, we risk losing users and increasing churn (If fact, we already had some churn cases because of MA).

### 5. Strategy

MAAC’s position is a Omnichannel Marketing Automation platform powered by AI.

**Why it's important**

The marketing automation market is fiercely competitive. Users demand robust automation for efficient, personalized multi-channel engagement. Without advanced journey capabilities, MAAC cannot meet these essential user needs or scale effectively, risking falling behind competitors.

**Why now**

Our current marketing automation limitations have contributed to customer churn. However, AI technology has matured significantly, offering a pivotal opportunity. This is the moment to invest in a next-generation, AI-powered Customer Journey solution, not just to address current gaps but to innovate and leapfrog the competition.

**How to win：Better-Different-New**

After conducting a competitor analysis (see [Appendix3- Competitor analysis](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_aldywm9g3jj5)), our strategy focuses on four key pillars to establish MAAC as a leading Journey solution:

* **Catchup: Quickly Add More Channels to Meet Basic Market Needs.**
  * MAAC will first deliver **Quick Wins** for immediate user value, such as better performance insight and improved triggers (see [Appendix 1- Requirement Analysis](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_wz1xf04lqsfs)). It will then **Expand to Multi-Channel** by building foundational IA and infrastructure, launching a second channel quickly, and potentially **outsourcing** further channel additions (3rd, 4th, 5th, and more) to rapidly match competitor offerings and reduce churn.
* **Better: Use MAAC's LINE Strength for Superior Multi-Channel Journeys.**
  * MAAC will make LINE the core of its multi-channel strategy. Other channels will support LINE by either bringing users _to_ LINE or by addressing communication gaps where LINE may not be the most effective tool. For example, SMS can be used to attract new users who are then transitioned to LINE for loyalty programs, or email can be used to reactivate inactive LINE users.
* **Different: Offer Unique Journeys with MAAC + CAAC 2-Way Conversations.**
  * MAAC will differentiate itself by moving beyond the one-way messages common in most MA tools. By combining its marketing automation platform (MAAC) with CAAC (its 2-way conversational AI platform), MAAC can utilize rich chat data to create truly interactive journeys. For instance, special marketing care can be triggered after a customer service chat, or products can be suggested based on needs users expressed during conversations.
* **New: Build a 10x Better Experience with AI-First Principles**
  * With an **AI-first strategy**, MAAC will identify where AI can **drastically improve upon traditional Marketing Automation's shortcomings**. If both AI and traditional solutions can solve a problem, **AI solutions will be prioritized when they offer substantial benefits**. For instance, an "AI Copilot" will enable faster, more customized journey creation than standard templates, boosting effectiveness. The user-friendliness of these AI tools will be carefully validated (see [Appendix 4- AI features](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_ezc7932tihc0)).

### 6. Roadmap (high-level) => Latest roadmap refer to backlog

According to the above strategy. This is the roadmap for a new journey (from v2.1 to 3.0+).

Evolution: Quick wins (single channel) → Multi-channel journey → Add AI co-pilot → More channels/ more scenarios

Note: the scope of each version might be changed over time

### 7. TA - Problem - Solution - Selling Points

**Key Differentiators once MAAC Journey evolved to v3.0**

Aligned with MAAC’s journey strategy, here are the key differentiators by Better-Different-New framework

* **Better: LINE expertise** MAAC's competitive advantage lies in its unparalleled LINE expertise, which remains its foundational strength. Even as MAAC expands to multi-channel capabilities, these new avenues will be designed to enhance and maintain a strong connection to the core LINE experience, offering a more cohesive and effective journey than competitors who lack this deep specialization.
* **Different: MAAC (1-way) + CAAC (2-way)** MAAC distinguishes itself from typical marketing automation platforms through its CAAC . This focus on genuine 2-way conversations transforms automated journeys into dynamic, interactive dialogues—a unique strength MAAC will fully leverage to create more engaging and responsive customer interactions.
* **New: AI-first** Unlike traditional multi-channel journeys, MAAC's key innovation is the deep integration of AI. This makes artificial intelligence the standout feature of its journey evolution, driving smarter automation and more personalized customer experiences.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complex & Slow Journey Setup**: Hard to create journeys; no easy start with templates. | 3.0: AI Journey generation for faster, simpler setup.            | Easier and faster to setup by using MAAC AI co-pilot                                                |
| **Single Channel Limitation**: LINE-only; cannot engage on other channels.               | 2.5+: Multi-channel integration (SMS, WhatsApp, Web chat, etc.). | LINE-centric multi-channel: Seamlessly extend LINE strategies, enhancing with CAAC across channels. |
| **Inflexible Triggers**: Hard to set specific/recurring times or complex behaviors.      | 2.2: time-based triggers and rules (Countdown)                   | Precise, flexible LINE scheduling.                                                                  |
| **Limited Journey Actions**: Few action types beyond sending messages.                   | 2.5+: More actions (Tags, CAPI, API, CDH integration).           | Enable users to achieve more marketing scenarios.                                                   |
| **Lack of Performance Insight**: Low visibility on journey step performance.             | 2.1: Node metrics (traffic, sent, opens) & node-based segments.  | Table stakes: enable users to view the detailed node performance.                                   |
| **Inefficient Journey Updates**: Manual changes are slow and error-prone.                | 3.5: AI-assisted updates & better UI for easier changes.         | Simplified journey management: AI suggests efficient changes and improvement.                       |
| **Limited Optimization Tools**: No A/B testing or dynamic adjustment tools.              | 3.5: AI Journey Optimizer & A/B testing.                         | AI optimization tailored: Uses MAAC's data & CAAC context, surpassing standard A/B tests.           |

* [A - View Node Performance \[P0\]](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_uhhotlic3z3p)

#### A - View Node Performance Data \[P0]

#### User story

* As a marketer, I want to see detailed performance metrics (including traffic count, message sent, and open count) for each journey node, so that I can understand how each step is performing and identify areas for improvement.

#### Flow

1. The user enters the "Journey" section in MAAC.
2. **Empty state**: Before users publish the journey, there are no node performance metrics in the journey editor page and journey view page.
3. **Display metrics**: Once users create a journey, after a while (wait for data update), each node will display key metrics in both journey editor and view pages, and the performance metrics summary will display in the top area of the journey view page.
4. **Edit node details:** When users click “pause and edit”, user can edit the node details (note: users are not able to create a new node or delete a node after publishing the journey) and there are two types of cases need to handle
5. Case 1: duplicate. When users change the trigger type (e.g.: from tag trigger to open LINE msg), users will see the pop-up dialog with “duplicate” and “cancel” options. 1. If users click the “duplicate” button, the system will create a new journey for users. 2. If users click the “cancel” button, the system will go back to the previous step without saving changes.
6. Case 2: kind reminder. When users change the other settings (other than changing the trigger type), users will see the side drawer with “save” and “cancel” options, and the info to remind users to note the time of this change for before/ after analysis. 1. If users click the “save” button, the system will save the changes. 2. If users click the “cancel” button, the system will go back to the previous step without saving changes.

View the Trigger node.                           | The node displays "# of trigger events: x" and "Traffic Count: y" (or reflects the precise definition from the data source).      |
| **TC-2.02** | Validate "Action (Send LINE message)" node metrics. | A message node sends to x users. y open it, and z click a link. This generates m orders totaling $n. | 1. Open the journey. 2. View the Action node.                            | The node correctly displays: "Traffic Count: x", "Message Sent: x", "Open count: y", "Click count: z", "Order: m", "Revenue: $n". |
| **TC-2.03** | Validate "Rule" node metrics.                       | x users reach a rule node. y meet the criteria, and z do not.                                        | 1. Open the journey. 2. View the Rule node.                              | The node correctly displays "# of rule events" and "Traffic count: x". The subsequent Splites should show a y% / z% split.        |
| **TC-2.04** | Validate data update frequency.                     | An active journey is running.                                                                        | 1. Trigger a new user to enter the journey. 2. Observe the Trigger node. | The metrics on the node should update to reflect the new data within the specified regular interval (n minutes).                  |

Open the journey from the list.                        | All performance metric values on all nodes should be 0 or display as empty, indicating no activity.            |
| **TC-3.02** | Verify behavior for a journey with zero traffic.       | A journey is active, but no users have met the trigger condition.   | 1. Open the journey.                                      | All performance metric values should be 0.                                                                     |

### 9.2 Scope (v2.2)

#### Background

**Time-based trigger (target segment) + Add/Remove Tag => unblock segment RM**

* In alignment with the [2025H2- MAAC Product Strategy Narratives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUmfDzsxwUK_NYbteNmKizvC5n-Qt-2QVjzGrRLq2yE/edit?tab=t.0), our goal is to be channel-agnostic rather than channel-specific. Therefore, direct optimization within LINE RichMenu is not a viable path. Instead, we aim to leverage **Journey** to enhance long-term product extensibility and flexibility across channels.
* For the **Segment-based Richmenu** feature, we will **not** make any changes to the existing Richmenu mechanism. Additionally, **reporting** will continue to link back to the original Richmenu functionality for data viewing.

**Requirements**

* Marketers want to tailor the particular segment based on attributes such as CAAC tags, purchase behavior, or multi-tag filters.
* MRR Impact Overview
  * **Confirmed Existing MRR Impact**: JPY: ¥57,000 with Takeya
  * **Additional Upside**: Potentially significant via OWNDAYS

**A - Trigger Node: Time-based Trigger (target specific segment)**

**User story**

* As a marketer, I want to create a journey that triggers based on a specific date and time (e.g., to launch a holiday promotion precisely at midnight), and I also want to set this trigger to recur (e.g., every Monday morning for a weekly update, on the 1st of every month for a newsletter, or every day at a specific time for daily tasks) while targeting a specific segment, so that I can schedule campaigns accurately in advance and automate regular communications without manual setup each time.

**Trigger Node Concept**

* **Journey Event Trigger needs to include time, people, and event. (Who, When, What)**
  * **Time**: At the moment of the event, on a set schedule (e.g., daily/weekly/monthly)
  * **People**: The user who triggered the event, or a defined segment based on CDH attributes.
  * **Event**: Triggered by the user’s action or automatically by the system.

**Flow**

1. User creates a new journey or edits an existing one.
2. User adds or selects a Trigger node on the canvas.
3. User sets a Time for when the trigger should fire.
4. _(Optional)_ User enables the Repeat checkbox to set up recurrence.
5. _(If Repeat is enabled)_ User configures recurrence options:

* Selects one or more Frequencies:
  * Daily
  * Weekly → selects one or more days of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday)
  * Monthly → selects one or more days of the month (e.g., 1st, 15th)

6. _(Optional)_ User sets an End Recurrence Date or keeps the default “Never”.
7. User saves the configuration.
8. On the configured Time, the trigger fires and users in the entry segment enter the journey.
9. If recurrence is enabled, the trigger continues to fire at the defined intervals.
10. Users added to the entry segment later will enter on the next valid trigger time.

**Spec**

**| Basic Configuration (Always Shown)**

* **Start Date**
  * _Type_: Date picker (yyyy/MM/dd)
  * _Description_: The date the trigger becomes active or the first occurrence if recurring.
* **Time**
  * _Type_: Time picker (hh:mm)
  * _Description_: The time of day the trigger will fire.
* **Segment**
  * _Type_: Multi-select group (similar as the segment selector in Broadcast)
  * _Description_: The selected contacts the trigger will target.

**| Recurrence Configuration (Shown only if "Repeat" is enabled)**

* **Repeat**
  * _Type_: Checkbox
  * _Description_: Enables recurring trigger behavior.
* **Frequencies**
  * _Type_: Multi-select group (support selecting more than one frequency)
  * _Options_:
    * \*\*Daily:\*\*Fires at the same time every day.
    * \*\*Weekly:\*\*Additional field: **Days of Week** → Multi-select dropdown (e.g., Monday, Thursday)
    * \*\*Monthly:\*\*Additional field: **Days of Month**→ Multi-select dropdown or numeric input (e.g., 1, 15, 31)
* **End Recurrence (Optional)**
  * _Options_:
    * **Never** _(default)_
    * **On Date**:
      * _Type_: Date picker
      * _Description_: Last possible day the trigger can fire.

**| Execution Logic**

* On the **Start Date**, the trigger fires at the configured **Time** for all users in the journey's selected entry **segment**.
* If **Repeat** is enabled:
  * The trigger fires repeatedly according to the selected **Frequencies**.
  * Multiple frequency rules may be active in parallel. The trigger should fire **multiple times**, once for each rule that is met. This could cause a user to enter the journey multiple times on the same day.
    * Example: "Every 1st and 15th of the month at 09:00 AM" **AND** "Every Monday at 09:00 AM".
  * If a selected Monthly day (e.g., 31st) does not exist in a given month, the trigger will **not** fire for that month.

**B - Action Node: Add/Remove Tag**

**User story**

* As a marketer, I want to automatically add a specific tag to contacts based on their interaction or status at a specific journey node (e.g., tag users as 'Engaged\_PromoX' if they opened the promo message at that node), so that I can easily categorize and identify these contacts for ongoing personalization or future campaigns without necessarily creating a full, separate segment.
* As a marketer, I want to automatically remove a specific tag from contacts based on their interaction or status at a specific journey node (e.g., remove the ‘high potential purchase’ tag if they already have completed purchase), so that I can easily manage the effective tags on contacts for better personalization.

**Flow**

1. User selects a specific node on the journey canvas.
2. An option like "Apply Action from Node" is available. User selects "Add/Remove Tag".
3. A modal or interface appears.
4. User defines the **Criteria** for applying the tag (same options as segment creation: "Reached this node," "Opened message," etc.).
5. User selects tag source of MAAC or CAAC
6. User selects an **Existing Tag** from a searchable dropdown list.
7. User confirms the action. The selected tag is applied to all users who currently meet the defined criteria at that node.

**Spec**

* **User Inclusion Criteria:**
  * Once the contacts who reached Node X, then auto add or remove tag.
* **Tag Selection:**
  * Searchable dropdown list to find the desired tag, including MAAC/CAAC/CDH tag source.
  * Support multiple tags, a maximum is 5 tags.
* **Application:**
  * It will automatically tag new users passing through the node after this action is performed.



**C - Split Node: Open/Click Message → Removed feature C from v2.2 (combine into interaction node)User Story As a marketer, I want to create a Split in the journey that splits contacts based on whether they have opened or clicked a LINE message sent at the previous step, so that I can deliver more personalized follow-up actions based on their engagement behavior.**

**Flow**

* This Split can only be used immediately after a "Send LINE Message" action node.
* When a user reaches this Split, the system checks if the contact has opened or clicked the LINE message sent at the preceding node.
* Contacts who opened or clicked the message proceed along the "Engaged" path, while those who did not proceed along the "Not Engaged" path.
* Marketers can configure different actions or subsequent nodes for each path accordingly.

**Spec**

* Applicable only to journeys where the previous node is a "Send LINE Message" action.
* Engagement criteria include:
  * Contacts who opened / did not open the message after A Days / B Hours / C Minutes the contact receive the message.
  * Contacts who clicked / did not click the message after A Days / B Hours / C Minutes the contact open the message.
* The Split supports single or multiple LINE message engagements but must be linked directly after the send action node.



**D - Node Performance**

**User Story**

As a marketer, I want to evaluate how scheduled triggers and tag-based actions perform in my journey, so I can:

* Validate whether recurring triggers are effectively reaching my target segment on schedule.
* Confirm whether tag applications/removals are occurring as expected, to maintain accurate contact classification.
* Analyze node-level engagement to iterate on timing and segmentation strategies.

**Flow**

1. Marketer creates or edits a journey with:

* A Time-based Trigger node configured with schedule and recurrence rules.
* One or more Add/Remove Tag Action nodes applied at key journey steps based on behavioral criteria.

2. At each scheduled time, the trigger fires and eligible users enter the journey.
3. As users move through the journey, system applies or removes tags based on defined criteria at the action nodes.
4. Platform logs the node-level performance of both trigger executions and tag applications.
5. Marketer views node performance to analyze:

* Recurring trigger effectiveness (e.g., per date, per recurrence type).
* Execution rate and volume of tag actions (added/removed).
* Overall flow traffic and engagement at each stage.

**Spec**

Scope:

* Trigger Node: Time-based Trigger
* Rules Node: Add/Remove Tag
* Split Node: Open/Click Message

| Metric          | Description                                                            |

**E - Join LINE event trigger**

**User Story**

As a marketer, I want to trigger a journey the moment a user joins our LINE official account, so that I can immediately engage new followers with a welcome message and show the new friend richmenu, with an introductory offer, or a guided onboarding experience to improve conversion and retention from the very beginning.

**Flow**

1. A user adds the brand's LINE Official Account as a friend.
2. MAAC receives a "follow event" from LINE.
3. This event acts as a trigger for a specific journey.
4. The user who initiated the follow event is immediately entered into the journey to receive the pre-defined sequence of messages or actions.

**Spec**

* **Trigger Condition**: The journey is triggered by the "LINE Event - Add Friend" (當聯絡人加入好友).

**F - Block LINE event trigger**

**User Story**

As a marketer, I want to trigger a journey the moment a user blocks our LINE official account, so that I can automatically reach out via alternative channels like email or SMS. This allows me to understand the reason for their departure through a survey, attempt to win them back with a targeted offer, or simply maintain the customer relationship on a different platform, ultimately helping to reduce churn and gather crucial feedback.

**Flow**

1. A user blocks the brand's LINE Official Account.
2. MAAC receives an "unfollow event" from LINE.
3. This event acts as a trigger for a specific journey.
4. The user who initiated the block event is entered into the journey to trigger follow-up actions on other channels (e.g., send an email or SMS).

**Spec**

* Trigger Condition: The journey is triggered by the "LINE Event - Block Friend" (當聯絡人封鎖好友).

### 9.3 Scope (v2.3) (not for review yet; Lydia WIP)

#### Background

**SDK event trigger/Split + send Retargeting msg => (1) Retargeting P3 - port to journey (2) Real-time Journey be supported by SDK**

This is related to Phase 3 of the [PRD - Retargeting 2.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WOFbt7af3vZiFCPMf41cRHZ7QLzrBiWIeRXOh7Anys4/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.ftxogrdpax4a).We also aim to address the GA4 latency issue within the journey. Additionally, some enterprise clients may have concerns about granting GA4 access permissions. With an SDK integration, they would have more control over what data is shared with CL.

#### Success metric

* Adoption of new trigger or Split types (e.g.: SDK events) and new actions (e.g.: send retargeting msg) in X% of newly created journeys.

#### Feature list

* [SDK event trigger/Split](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_54h2iwq9s779)
* [Send retargeting msg](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_emmudynq13ku)
* [Node and Report Performance](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_ttgi0n6i1fds)

**A - SDK event trigger/Split**

**User story**

* As a marketer, I want to set SDK event triggers or create journey Splites based on real-time customer behavior (e.g., page view, add to cart, purchase), so that I can personalize the journey experience based on whether or not a customer has completed key actions.

**Flow**

_Trigger Node_

1. User opens the Journey Builder interface.
2. In the trigger configuration panel, user selects **“SDK Event”** as the trigger type.
3. A dropdown appears with event options; user chooses one of the following: page\_view, add\_to\_cart, purchase
4. User confirms the selection.
5. The selected SDK event is now set as the entry trigger node of the journey.
6. The journey will start for any user who performs the selected SDK event in real-time.

_Filter / Split Node_

1. User opens the Journey Builder interface.
2. In the filter or Split configuration panel, user selects **“SDK Event”** as the filter or Split type.
3. A dropdown appears with event options; user chooses one of the following: page\_view, add\_to\_cart, purchase
4. User confirms the selection.
5. The selected SDK event is now set as the filter criteria or the Split node of the journey.
6. The journey will auto triage for any user who performs the selected SDK event in real-time.

**Spec**

* **Data source (selectable):**
  * The data source could be a GA4 event or an SDK event.
    * If the clients have both GA4 event and SDK event, then default choose SDK event and support the client to adjust in each journey.
    * If the clients only have GA4, then by default choose the GA4 and show SDK as a greyout option.
    * If the clients only have SDK, then by default choose the SDK and show GA4 as a greyout option.
* **Event type (selectable):**
  * The event type for trigger, filter or Split node could be selected in the dropdown list: page\_view, add\_to\_cart, purchase
* **Future Considerations (not in scope):**
* Allow event properties (e.g., product category, price) as additional conditions.
* Support custom events beyond the 3 default ones.

**B - Send Retargeting msg**

**User Story** As a marketer, I want to send a retargeting message to users who haven’t completed a purchase action with items in their shopping cart, so that I can bring them back into the purchase funnel and improve conversion rates.

**Flow**

_Send Retargeting Message Node_

* User opens the Journey Builder interface.
* In the action configuration panel, user selects “Send Retargeting Message” as the action type.
* User configures the message content (e.g., unpaid items).
* User confirms the configuration.
* The action node is now set to send the retargeting message when a user reaches this step in the journey.
* When the journey reaches this node, the system will automatically send the configured message to the user.

**Spec**_Message Content:_

* Configurable using the MAAC message editor.

_Delivery Conditions (optional):_

* Delay sending (e.g., “Send 2 hours after abandonment”).
* Send only during specific time windows (e.g., 9AM–9PM user time).

**C - Node and Report Performance**

**User Story**

As a marketer, I want to evaluate how SDK event trigger/Split and Send Retargeting msg perform in my journey, so I can:

* Confirm whether the new nodes are occurring as expected, to maintain accurate contact classification.
* Analyze node-level engagement to iterate on strategies.

**Flow**

1. Marketer creates or edits a journey with SDK event trigger/Split and Send Retargeting msg.
2. At each trigger event happens, the trigger fires and eligible users enter the journey.
3. As users reach the send retargeting msg action node in the journey, system auto send the retargeting message based on defined criteria at the action nodes.
4. Platform logs the node-level performance of both trigger, split and action executions.
5. Marketer views node performance to analyze:

* Trigger effectiveness.
* Execution rate and volume of actions.
* Overall flow traffic and engagement at each stage.

### 9.X Scope (v2.X) (not for review yet; Lydia WIP)

#### Background

**interaction split node + Journey event pipeline for omnichannel**

In the second half of 2025, we aim to transition toward full omnichannel marketing automation. As part of this shift, the interaction split node will serve as one of the foundational building blocks.

In this release, we will enhance the journey event pipeline to support omnichannel scenarios and introduce a new interaction split node. This node allows marketers to assess whether a customer interacted with the previous message (e.g., opened or clicked), enabling them to create split branches based on those behaviors and define follow-up actions tailored to different user segments.

#### Success metric

* Adoption of new interaction split node in X% of newly created journeys.

#### Feature list

* [interaction split node](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_a1qkl71v3kt8)
* [Node and Report Performance](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_w36cez228ym8)

**A - interaction split node**

**User story**

As a marketer, I want to split the journey based on whether a user opened or clicked the previous message (according to different channels), so that I can deliver personalized follow-up actions depending on their level of engagement.

**Flow**

_interaction split node_

1. Marketer sets up a journey with a message-sending node (e.g., LINE, SMS, Email).
2. Adds an interaction split node immediately after the send message node.
3. In the interaction split node, selects the interaction criteria (e.g., "Message Opened", "Link Clicked").
4. System evaluates user behavior for that specific message.
5. Based on whether the user met the selected criteria, the journey splits into two branches (Yes / No).
6. Each branch can lead to a different follow-up action (e.g., resend, tag, offer incentive).

**Spec**

_Supported Channels_

* LINE, SMS
* Additional channels to be supported in future iterations.

_Supported Events (per channel)_

* LINE: Open, Click
* SMS: Click

_Node Input_

* Must follow immediately after a supported Action Node
* Configurable condition: Open, Click

_Node Output_

* Two split:
  * Yes – Users who matched the interaction criteria
  * No – Users who did not match the criteria within the defined window

_Time Window for Evaluation_

* Default: 24 hours
* Customizable: 1 to 72 hours

_Limitations_

* Only evaluates interaction with the immediately preceding message node
* Cannot evaluate multiple messages or aggregate interactions across nodes (MVP scope)

**B - Node and Report Performance**

**User Story**

As a marketer, I want to evaluate how the interaction split node performs in my journey, so I can:

* Confirm whether the new nodes are occurring as expected, to maintain accurate contact flow.
* Analyze node-level engagement to iterate on strategies.

**Flow**

1. Marketer creates or edits a journey with the interaction split node.
2. As users reach the interaction split node in the journey, system auto split the contacts based on defined criteria at the split nodes.
3. Platform logs the node-level performance of both split executions.
4. Marketer views node performance to analyze the split traffic and contacts.

**Spec**

_Scope:_

* Interaction split node

| Metric          | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Traffic counts  | Total number of times the split has been passed |
| Unique contacts | Total unique contacts pass through this split.  |

### 9.X Scope (v2.X) (not for review yet; Lydia WIP)

Time counter trigger + CDH data filter

#### Time counter

#### User story

* As a marketer, I want to create a journey reminder that triggers a set duration before or after a specific reference date (e.g., 1 day prior to an event, 3 days after a purchase for a review request), so that I can automate timely follow-ups.

#### Flow

1. User creates a new journey or edits an existing one.
2. User selects a date-type Custom Field from MAAC (e.g., "Birthday," "Subscription End Date," "Last Purchase Date").
3. User defines the time reminder offset: e.g., 7 days BEFORE "Birthday," or 1 month AFTER "Subscription End Date".
4. User sets the time of day for the trigger.

#### Spec

* Reference Date Field (dropdown of available date-type custom fields).
* Offset Number (integer).
* Offset Unit (Days, Weeks, Months).
* Offset Direction (Before, After).
* Time of day for execution.

Example: To send a birthday greeting: Reference Field = "Birthday", Offset = 0 days (or 1 day Before for pre-greeting), Time = 9:00 AM.

####

#### Node-based Segment or Tag \[P2]

#### User story

* **B.1 Segment creation \[P1]**
  * As a marketer, I want to be able to create a new MAAC segment of users based on their interaction or status at a specific journey node (e.g., users who reached node X, users who opened the message at node Y), so that I can conduct targeted follow-up actions or analysis.

**B.1. Segment creation \[P1]**

#### Flow

1. User views an active or completed journey with performance metrics.
2. User selects a specific node on the journey canvas or from a performance view.
3. An option like "Apply Action from Node" (or a direct "Create Segment") is available. User selects "Create Segment".
4. A modal or interface appears.
5. User defines the **Criteria** for including users in the segment (e.g., "Reached this node," "Opened message sent from this node," "Did NOT open message from this node").
6. User names the new segment.
7. User saves the segment. The segment (containing users who met the criteria at the time of creation) becomes available in the MAAC Segments list for other uses.

#### Spec

* **User Inclusion Criteria (selectable):**
  * Users who reached Node X.
  * Users who were sent a message from Node Y.
  * Users who opened a message from Node Z.
  * Users who did _not_ open a message from Node Z (but were sent it).
* The created segment is a static snapshot of users who met the criteria at the time of segment creation.
* Clear indication of the number of users who will be included in the segment before creation.

### 9.X Scope (v2.X) (WIP)

#### Background

While v2.3 introduced real-time capabilities with the SDK, many clients heavily rely on their existing GA4 setup for comprehensive web analytics. To deepen our integration and unlock more sophisticated marketing scenarios without requiring immediate SDK adoption, this version focuses on expanding our Journey triggers to support a wider range of standard and custom GA4 events.

By leveraging detailed GA4 events like scroll depth, form\_submit, and specific click actions, we empower marketers to create highly contextual and behavior-driven journeys. This allows them to react to nuanced user interest signals—such as deep engagement with a page or interaction with specific UI elements—and to seamlessly connect website form submissions with conversational follow-ups in LINE. This enhancement bridges the gap between web analytics and marketing automation, enabling more precise targeting and timely, personalized communication based on a richer understanding of user behavior.

#### Success Metric

* **Adoption:** ≥ 15% of newly created journeys utilize at least one of the new GA4 custom event triggers or splits within the first 3 months of release.
* **Engagement:** A 10% increase in the usage of behavior-based journey splits (compared to only tag-based splits) among active journey users.

#### Feature list

* A - Trigger/Split Node: GA4 Custom Event Trigger

**A - Trigger/Split Node: GA4 Custom Event Trigger**

**User Story** As a marketer, I want to trigger journeys or create splits based on a wider range of specific GA4 events, so I can design more granular and responsive campaigns that react to nuanced customer behaviors and interests demonstrated on my website.

**Flow**

1. The user opens the Journey Builder interface.
2. When configuring a Trigger or a Split node, the user selects "GA4 Event" as the type.
3. A new dropdown menu appears, allowing the user to select from an expanded list of standard GA4 events.
4. Depending on the selected event, additional input fields appear to specify event parameters (e.g., page\_location for page\_view, or a CSS selector for click).
5. The user configures the parameters and saves the node.
6. The journey will now trigger or split based on the specified GA4 event and its associated parameters, allowing for highly contextual automation.

**Spec**

The following GA4 events will be supported as journey triggers and split conditions.

**1. Event: click**

* **Description:** Triggers when a user clicks on a link or element.
* **Use Case:** When a user clicks on a specific category (e.g., "Recommendations for 18–25"), a tag can be added in MAAC, enrolling them in a product journey designed for that age group.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
  * link\_classes: The CSS class of the clicked element.
  * link\_domain: The domain of the clicked link.
  * link\_url: The full URL of the clicked link.
  * outbound: Boolean (true if the link leads away from the current domain).

**2. Event: form\_submit**

* **Description:** Triggers upon successful submission of a form.
* **Use Case:** After a user completes a consultation or catalog request form, they can be immediately transferred to a live agent on LINE for a personal follow-up, bypassing the standard nurturing sequence.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
  * form\_id: The ID of the submitted form.
  * form\_name: The name of the submitted form.

**3. Event: page\_view**

* **Description:** Triggers when a user views a page. (Enhanced with location and referrer data).
* **Use Case:** Track which traffic sources and landing pages lead to key actions, allowing for user segmentation based on campaign, product, or referral source.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
  * page\_location: The full URL of the page being viewed. (Supports "contains" or "equals" matching).
  * page\_referrer: The URL of the referring page.

**4. Event: scroll**

* **Description:** Triggers when a user scrolls to a certain depth on a page.
* **Use Case:** If a user scrolls to 90% of a detailed page (like a course description), a LINE message can be triggered via MAAC to provide advanced information or a special offer, capitalizing on their demonstrated interest for real-time interaction.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
  * percent\_scrolled: Numeric value (e.g., 90).

**5. Events: session\_start / user\_engagement**

* **Description:** Triggers based on session initiation or engagement duration.
* **Use Case:**
  * session\_start: Identify returning visitors as a strong indicator of sustained interest.
  * user\_engagement: Evaluate the depth of interaction within a single visit (based on GA4's engagement time parameter). These metrics can define highly active users and trigger more frequent or personalized journeys in MAAC.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
  * session\_start: No parameters needed.
  * user\_engagement: engagement\_time\_msec (e.g., trigger if greater than 60000ms).

**6. Event: add\_to\_wishlist (Custom Event for "add to favorite product")**

* **Description:** Triggers when a user adds an item to their favorites or wishlist. This relies on the client implementing a custom add\_to\_wishlist event in their GA4 setup.
* **Use Case:** When a user favorites a product, a journey can be triggered to send a notification if that item goes on sale or comes back in stock, or to send a reminder after a few days.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
  * item\_id: The ID of the product added.
  * item\_name: The name of the product added.
  * value: The price of the item.

Lydia proposal for current releasing

* **Proposal 1：在 Segment 支援 Add/Remove Tag 功能**
  * 內容：
    * 在 Segment 中新增支援「Add/Remove Tag」的操作
    * 先解決當前 Segment 無法直接執行 RM（Remove Member）流程的問題
    * Journey 架構問題留待未來處理
  * Pros：
    * 操作流程清晰直觀，使用者在 Segment 編輯時即可設定要加/移除的 tag
    * 立即解決當前痛點，無需進入 Journey
  * Cons：
    * 目前 Journey 已有 Add/Remove Tag node，等於重複實作相似功能
    * 未來若調整 Journey 架構，可能導致這段邏輯需再次調整或移除（技術債）
* **Proposal 2：Segment Trigger 保留在 Journey，但限制後續只可接 Add/Remove Tag node**
  * 內容：
    * 目前仍使用 Journey 中的「Segment Trigger」作為入口
    * 但此階段選擇該 Trigger 後，只能接 Add/Remove Tag node，不開放其他操作
    * 同步規劃後續補上完整 Journey 架構優化
  * Pros：
    * 不需額外在 Segment 開發新功能，避免重工
    * 與現有 Journey node 架構一致
  * Cons：
    * 使用者體驗不夠直覺（例如：不知道選 segment trigger 後續無法接發送訊息）
    * 需要明確 roadmap 支撐後續架構處理，否則會卡在半成品狀態

***

![:point\_right::skin-tone-2:](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (66)>)個人推薦不重工的 proposal 2，同時也希望了解架構調整需要花多少 eng effort，是否有機會在 omni TF 前完成？

![:small\_blue\_diamond:](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (67)>)方向確認

目前共識方向：優先採用 Proposal 1（在 Segment 支援 Add/Remove Tag 功能） => daily 會再次口頭確認

原因：

* 根據 Jalex 評估，若要支援 Segment trigger 架構，涉及資料流程優化，至少需一季時間。=> 支援即時觸發、即時事件處理(real-time)，以及批次的處理(throughput) => 背後需要有 2 套系統才有辦法支撐
* 考量 H2 時程緊湊，重工風險高，且 Journey 架構若尚未到位，不宜貿然上線依賴該流程。
* Proposal 1 雖有重複邏輯，但能以最小開發成本解決現階段痛點，並為後續多渠道場景（如 AI Segment 保存）提供實用解法。

![:wrench:](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (68)>)後續兩個 Action

![:one:](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (69)>)確認 Proposal 1 的開發可行性與時程

* 請 [@Jhenyi Jhan](https://chatbotgang.slack.com/team/UE05YMW4E) 和 [@David Chou](https://chatbotgang.slack.com/team/U02MYBFH894) 協助評估以下事項：
* 在 Segment 中支援 Add/Remove Tag 的開發 effort 多大？
* 是否有機會在 Omnichannel TF 前，完成並支援上線？

![:two:](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (70)>)Segment Trigger 架構優化的排程與風險判斷

* 請 [@David Chou](https://chatbotgang.slack.com/team/U02MYBFH894) cc [@Peter](https://chatbotgang.slack.com/team/U0604K3CD60) 協助判斷以下事項：
* Omnichannel TF 後，是否有機會安排 TF 團隊投入架構優化？
* 若今年無法處理此項優化，是否會影響其他 event-based trigger，如 SDK events、GA4、CDH data？

感謝，細節可待稍後 daily 對焦確認。

#### 2025.07.28 Journey time discussion

Attendees: [Patty Hsu](mailto:patty.hsu@cresclab.com) [Jim Chen](mailto:jim.chen@cresclab.com) [Jhenyi Jhan](mailto:jhenyi.jhan@cresclab.com) [Noel Lo](mailto:noel.lo@cresclab.com) [Lydia Hou](mailto:lydia.hou@cresclab.com)

Decision

* Operating schedule: as-is
* Segment trigger node
  * Start and end follow the basic setting and disable for editing
  * Repeat Interval set in the trigger node![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (71)>)

Jim experience sharing

* 時間維度：包含活動檔期、用戶觸發進入旅程、資料欄位時間
* 當旅程檔期時間結束時，已在旅程中的用戶仍會走完旅程，僅不會有新的用戶進此旅程
  * 此題和現有機制不同
  * 過去收集到的旅程結束情境，希望檔期結束時，所有用戶自動離開此旅程，避免仍有用戶收到此旅程發出的訊息 e.g. 發放有時效性的優惠券、舉辦有時效性的活動

Future (To be discussed, not in v2.2)

* 關於檔期起訖的邏輯，及對應的時間設定，未來需判斷是否有需要調整現有邏輯 ([figma](https://www.figma.com/design/7yomMrvFPs9J268IlckbFG/MAAC_Customer-Journey_Design?node-id=4045-7342\&t=803qb2k2s7OQ9dpI-4) for 未來參考)
  * 以下為討論內容 → not final decision
    * 時間維度分為以下三種
      * 檔期時間 = 旅程時間 (現有 Operating schedule )
        * 旅程時間定義：通常 MA 旅程為 user 可以被觸發的時間點，並不是 user 進入旅程到結束的時間
        * 旅程時間舉例：設定2025/07/28 10:00 開始 2025/07/28 23:59結束，使用者在 23:58觸發之後會跑完整個旅程結束，不會在 23:59 被強製結束
      * Trigger 觸發時間
        * Event-base : 滿足設定條件當下
        * Time-base : 第一次為旅程開始時間，第二次開始則是跟隨資料更新時間，不會在 segment 的節點上讓使用者設定更新時間 (可以只觸發一次就好，等於旅程開始的時間)
      * Node 時間
        * 這目前沒有遇到問題，所以沒有多討論
    * From Patty 希望未來會朝向時間設定都在 Basic Settings ，Trigger不會另外讓使用者手動設定時間
    * From Lydia 過去提出一個客戶需要的情境，希望 user 就在某一個時間點一定要結束旅程，避免仍有用戶收到此旅程發出的訊息 e.g. 發放有時效性的優惠券、舉辦有時效性的活動
    * From Jim 建議或許是在 End node 的節點上 新增旅程結束的時間，如果真的有需要可以 End node 上設定旅程結束時間，強制 user 離開旅程

#### 2025.05.20 v2.1 clarifications for node performance

* Some questions raised by [Gideon Pan](mailto:gideon.pan@cresclab.com)
  * Block attribution: [https://chatbotgang.slack.com/archives/C08JZHN576Z/p1747380633203759?thread\_ts=1747205124.890269\&cid=C08JZHN576Z](https://chatbotgang.slack.com/archives/C08JZHN576Z/p1747380633203759?thread_ts=1747205124.890269\&cid=C08JZHN576Z)
  * Time filter: [https://chatbotgang.slack.com/archives/C08JZHN576Z/p1747383088430809?thread\_ts=1747205124.890269\&cid=C08JZHN576Z](https://chatbotgang.slack.com/archives/C08JZHN576Z/p1747383088430809?thread_ts=1747205124.890269\&cid=C08JZHN576Z)
  * Peter’s thoughts
    * Regarding **block attribution**topic
    * **IMO, the block info should be attributed to the closest node where users blocked the LINE OA.**
      * But let’s take a step back, why do marketers want to know the blocked info?
      * Because it helps them know if the marketing message is too annoying or not.
      * Hence, we should show the block info at two places
        * Overview: how many blocks caused by this entire journey
        * Node: blocked info should be attributed on the closest node where users block the LINE OA

For example, users pass node A -> node B -> node C → blocked the LINE OA.

We should attribute the block info to “node C”.

*
  *
    * Regarding **time filter** topic
    * IMO, let’s not add the time filter at the moment.
      * Let’s also take a step back, why do marketers want to have a time filter?
      * Because it helps them analyze the trend.
      * I think the purpose of “node performance” is to let marketers understand the performance of this particular node.
      * Adding the time filter will make the behavior too complicated.
      * IMO, the best place to add a time filter is at a reporting dashboard or to leverage AI (in the future), that’s the right place for advanced analysis.
      * Hence, my decision is
        * If it is not difficult to add the time filter in the future (two-way door)
        * Then I will suggest not adding a time filter this time (v2.1).

#### 2025.05.13 Concept Review with Pod1

Expected outcomes: able to understand the goals, problem being solved, and high level solutions

Discussion topics

* Is v2.1’s problem space and scope clear? Any feedback about v2.1’s scope?
* Can I quickly check if we can deliver the following features in Q2?
  * [A - View Node Performance \[P0\]](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_uhhotlic3z3p)
  * [B - Node-based Segment Creation \[P1\]](prd-journey-from-2.1-to-3.0+.md#_23sfslml0eqx)

### Background

* **Analytics is baseline**: Competitors (Omnichat, BotBonnie, Omnisegment) already have journey node metrics; this is table-stakes for marketers.
* \*\*Blind optimization:\*\*Marketers don’t know contact journey progress, so they guess when adjusting setups. Detailed node metrics provide missing visibility.
* \*\*AI Journey Foundation:\*\*This is the first milestone in our AI Journey and the foundation for our upcoming MAAC co-pilot.

### Introduction

Customer Journey node-level metrics provide an in-context dashboard on every step of a Journey.

* **What users see**
  * On every node (all types): Traffics (repeated events), Unique contacts
  * On message-sending nodes: + Messages pushed, Opens, Clicks, Unique clicks, Orders, Revenue
  * On Split nodes: % of traffic split to “Yes/No” Split
  * Journey-level summary: Message pushed, Opens (%), Clicks (%), Unique clicks (%), GA events (add-to-cart, orders, revenue)
* **Where users see it**
  * Edit page – provide users with immediate reference points to adjust nodes during the campaign.
  * Report page – summary panel for an at-a-glance overview, with options to drill down and navigate the date range.

#### Target Audience & Selling Points

* **Marketers** – focus on customer engagement & conversions
  * Pain point

Need to keep journeys engaging and conversion-focused, but without step-by-step data they can’t tell which message, delay, or Split is dragging performance down.

*
  * **Selling point**

_Node metrics (traffic, opens, clicks, orders) spotlight drop-offs and high-performers in real time, so you can tweak copy, timing, or targeting during campaigns to optimize engagement and conversions._

* **CRM Managers** – focus on customer LTV
  * Pain point

Without step-by-step data, they can’t pinpoint where members drop out, stall, or re-engage. This makes it hard to design precise retention, upgrade, or win-back nudges, and even harder to prove their impact.

*
  * **Selling point**_Node metrics pinpoint where members engage or drop out, enabling precise fixes that lift active member count and retention._

#### Scenario

* ### **Scenario #1: Delay reminder shows high opens but low clicks/orders**
  * User goal: Keep contacts engaged and ready to act
  * How:
    1. Marketer sees the “Delay 3 days → Reminder” node with high opens but low clicks/orders.
    2. They shorten the delay to 1 day, republish, and test clicks improvement in the next few days.
* ### **Scenario #2: Funnel drops between “Website visit” and “Add to Cart”**
  * User goal: Rescue traffic and increase checkout start
  * How:
    1. Node metrics show a sharp traffic fall after “website visit” to “Add to Cart” node.
    2. Marketer broadens the preceding condition from “Add to Cart” to “Viewed specific product page” so more visitors enter the “yes” spit Split.
    3. Verify higher traffic and conversions through the path.

#### Combine Feature

* **GA Integration** – import website behaviors (page views, add-to-cart, checkout, etc.) into Journey metrics, linking on-site actions with each node’s performance.
* **SDK Event Tracking (coming soon)** – stream real-time site events straight into Journey for instant triggers and up-to-the-second optimisation.

### Note & FAQ

#### Note

* **Data update frequency**
  * Metrics refresh hourly.
* **Journey editing limits**
  * Once a journey is published, the node structure is locked: you cannot add or delete nodes.
  * You may pause the journey and adjust node conditions (e.g., delay days, audience filters).
  * Trigger settings are locked. Changing them prompts the system to duplicate the journey, so you can re-configure and publish a new version.
* **How metrics behave after edits**
  * The platform does not keep version history; metrics continue accumulating on the edited nodes.
  * If you need separate metrics for each configuration, clone the journey first or keep your own timestamped notes for comparison.
* **Only journey created after v2.1 (2025.08.11) will have node metrics**
  * **Context:** ENG changed the data source from MAAC-only data to CL-wide Engagement History data to enable CL-wide data applications and simplify data management through centralization.
  * Due to this change in the data source, the following limitations apply to node metrics.

#### FAQ

_**Q1. Do I need to enable anything?**_

* No. Node-level metrics appear automatically on all new **and** existing journeys.

_**Q2. How fresh is the data?**_

* Metrics refresh **hourly**.

_**Q3. Will historical data be back-filled?**_

* **Yes, for most metrics.** The system will back-process historical journey traffic, sent, opens, clicks, orders, and revenue.
* **Exception:** **Unique Clicks** and **Unique CTR** start accumulating only from **2025-07-07** and are **not** back-filled.

_**Q4. Which metrics appear on each node?**_

* **Yes.** The system back-processes _all_ node metrics—traffic, sent, opens, clicks, **unique clicks/CTR**, orders, and revenue—so past journeys show complete data from day one of the feature.

_**Q5. What if I need a new node or a different trigger?**_

* Duplicate the journey, make the structural changes, and publish the new version.

**Journey Performance Metrics**

**\[P0] As a marketer, I want to view the total number of times a time-based trigger has fired and the number of unique contacts who entered the journey through it, so that I can evaluate the effectiveness of my scheduled campaigns. \[PM-P0-1]**

* 📝 **\[FE]** \[PM-P0-1-Test1]: Verify the journey report UI displays "Times Fired" and "Unique Contacts Entered" for the trigger node.
  * **Expected Result:** The two metrics are clearly displayed on or near the trigger node.
* 📝 **\[DE/BE]** \[PM-P0-1-Test2]: Verify the "Times Fired"\*”# of contacts in segment” count increments each time a recurring trigger executes.
  * **Expected Result:** After a daily trigger runs for 3 days and segment is 150 contacts, the count is 3\*150 = 450.
* 📝 **\[DE/BE]** \[PM-P0-1-Test3]: Verify the "Unique Contacts Entered" accurately reflects the distinct number of users who have entered the journey, even across multiple runs.
  * **Expected Result:** If the same user enters a journey on Monday and again on Tuesday, the unique count only increments by 1 total.

**\[P0] As a marketer, I want to view performance metrics on the Add/Remove Tag node, so that I can confirm my user categorization is working as expected. \[PM-P0-2]**

* 📝 **\[FE]** \[PM-P0-2-Test1]: Verify the UI displays the total number of users who have passed through the tag node.
  * **Expected Result:** A counter is visible on the node.

**\[P0] As a marketer, I want to view the traffic count through each path of an engagement-based Split, so that I can analyze the performance of my message content and calls to action. \[PM-P0-3]**

* 📝 **\[FE]** \[PM-P0-3-Test1]: Verify the UI displays separate user counts on the "Yes" path and the "No" path exiting the Split node.
  * **Expected Result:** Two distinct counters are visible, one for each Split.
* 📝 **\[DE/BE]** \[PM-P0-3-Test2]: Verify the counts on each path are accurate.
  * **Expected Result:** If 50 users click and 150 do not, the "Yes" count is 50 and the "No" count is 150.
* 📝 **\[DE/BE]** \[PM-P0-3-Test3]: Verify that the sum of the "Yes" and "No" path counts equals the total number of users who have entered the Split node.
  * **Expected Result:** count(yes) + count(no) == count(in).

**Non-Functional Requirements**

**\[P1] As an engineer, I want the journey trigger and execution system to be performant and scalable, so that it can handle large user segments and high-frequency schedules without delays or failures. \[NFR-P0-1]**

* 📝 **\[Infra/BE]** \[NFR-P0-1-Test1]: (Performance) Measure the duration of the segment evaluation process for a large segment (e.g., 4 million users).
  * **Expected Result:** The process completes well within the pre-trigger time window (e.g., under 1 hour, as per the PRD).
* 📝 **\[Infra/BE]** \[NFR-P0-1-Test2]: (Scalability) Load test the trigger mechanism by scheduling a large number of journeys (e.g., 4M) to fire at the exact same time.
  * **Expected Result:** All journeys trigger within an acceptable time frame (e.g., 60 minutes) of the scheduled time, and the system remains stable.
* 📝 **\[Infra/BE]** \[NFR-P0-1-Test3]: (Reliability) Simulate a server failure (e.g., kill a pod) during the segment evaluation process.
  * **Expected Result:** The system recovers and either completes the evaluation successfully or safely retries, ensuring no users are lost or processed twice.

**\[P1] As a data engineer, I want journey performance metrics to be accurate and processed efficiently, so that marketers can trust the reports. \[NFR-P1-2]**

* 📝 **\[DE]** \[NFR-P1-2-Test1]: (Data Integrity) Run a journey with 100,000 users through multiple Splites and verify that the sum of counts at each level of the journey tree matches the total number of initial users.
  * **Expected Result:** No users are "lost" in the metric pipeline. SUM(node\_N\_outputs) == SUM(node\_N-1\_outputs).
* 📝 **\[DE]** \[NFR-P1-2-Test2]: (Performance) Measure the data latency for metrics to appear in the UI after an action occurs.
  * **Expected Result:** Node counts are updated in the reporting UI within a specified time frame (e.g., 1 hour ) of the event.

| **Latest update**       | The Segment Trigger in Journey has been a long-requested feature from GTM. However, during stress testing, triggering a segment with 1M audience members caused excessive system load. Considering both the test results and the overall Journey architecture, we have decided not to proceed with this feature's release at this stage.Following multiple discussions on enhancements related to Journey v2.2, the current direction is as follows: - \[Journey v2.2 - 1] Follow/unfollow LINE Event Trigger in Journey - Scheduled for Tiered Release starting 8/26. - \[Journey v2.2 - 2] Segment: Add & Remove Tag - As this cannot be fully automated to meet real-time business scenarios, it will be placed in the backlog. - Some related needs (e.g., quick campaign setups) still exist, so timeline is TBD. - \[Journey v2.2 - 3] Rich Menu Switch by Segment \[Outsourced] - Although the current focus is LINE, demand remains strong. - This feature will be handled by an outsourcing partner, with the release date TBD. |

### Background

In today's competitive digital landscape, personalization at scale is no longer a luxury—it's an expectation. Marketers are moving away from generic, one-off campaign "blasts" and toward creating continuous, automated conversations that adapt to a user's behavior over their entire lifecycle. The core market trend is a shift towards efficiency and intelligence: delivering the right message to the right person at the right time, without exhaustive manual effort.

Our company-level strategy focuses on deepening customer engagement and increasing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). Journey v2.2 is a critical step in this direction. Previously, our Journey feature was a powerful tool for building campaign flows, but it often required manual activation and followed a static path.

We built Journey v2.2 to solve our clients' most pressing automation challenges. They told us they were spending too much time manually scheduling weekly newsletters, couldn't easily identify and reward their most engaged users in real-time, and lacked a simple way to clean up user segments based on journey interactions. Journey v2.2 directly addresses this by transforming our Journey feature from a simple campaign tool into an intelligent, "set it and forget it" marketing automation engine that drives the entire customer lifecycle. The primary business driver for this update was to unblock automated, segment-based Rich Menu switching—a highly requested and powerful feature for personalization.

### Introduction

**Journey v2.2: Time-based (target specific segment) Triggers & Engagement Split** **& Add/Remove Tag node**is a significant enhancement to our core marketing automation Journey feature. It introduces three new, powerful node types that work in concert to create truly dynamic, responsive, and timely customer experiences.

🆚 **Optimization for: Journey Automation & Workflow** This update is a major optimization of the marketer's workflow. It moves from a basic trigger system to a fully automated one.

### Note & FAQ

#### Note

* A journey's Time-Based Trigger can only have **one recurrence rule** (e.g., you cannot set a journey to trigger _both_ every Monday and on the 15th of the month).
* The system updates the target segment\*\* in the early morning on the day\*\* the journey is triggered. Users added to the segment after this update time will be included in the next run, not the current one.
* The Engagement Split node can only check the open/click status of the **immediately preceding** "Send LINE Message" node.
* The maximum number of tags that can be added or removed in a single node is 5.

#### FAQ

1. **Q: If I set a journey to run daily, can the same user enter it every day?**

* A: Yes. If the user is still in the target segment when the trigger runs, they will re-enter the journey. This is useful for daily updates but be sure your journey logic handles re-entry gracefully. If the client want to set up the upper limit of entry times to the user, please use the “Trigger limitation”.

2. **Q: Can this feature directly change a user's Rich Menu?**

* A: Not directly, but it's the critical first step. You use the "Add Tag" node to give a user a specific tag (e.g., "VIP"). Then, our Rich Menu system uses that "VIP" tag to automatically switch them to the VIP menu. This journey feature is the engine that enables that automated personalization.

3. **Q: Does the segment trigger include both CDH segments and AI segments?**

* A: Yes, the segment trigger supports both CDH segments and AI segments.

4. **Q: I want to ask if “分眾是根據歷史資料產生，並會在觸發時間前 2 小時更新” is wrong? The segment should be updated follow by the current mechanism - Catherine**

* ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (86)>)

5. **Q: Which tag that journey action of “Add a tag”? - Catherine**

* MAAC Tag

6. **Q: 我得用中文問 XD 想問我的理解對不對「我設定一個旅程為 A 分眾，每天 10:00 觸發跑一次，現在分眾更新機制為跟著隔一天有沒有被安排推播，假設沒有安排，每天 10:00 時，沒有任何聯絡人跑進來；假設有被安排，03:00-06:00 時，不會發生事情，但 10:00 時，旅程觸發開始跑，A 分眾沒有更新前的 a, b 聯絡人和更新後新加入的 c 聯絡人，就會跑進來，因此 a,b,c 聯絡人真正觸發旅程的時間，是 10:00，並不是分眾被更新的時間」- Catherine**

### Setting (For CSM)

All features are configured directly within the Journey canvas UI. No special backend settings are required for activation.

* **To Enable for a Customer:** Ensure the client’s plan includes the advanced Journey feature set.
* **Setup Guide:** For a detailed walkthrough on setting up a Rich Menu switch based on a journey tag, please refer to the CSM Advanced Playbook: \[Link to CSM Playbook Document].

### Scenario

\[not supported in journey v2.2] User Story 1: Switch Richmenu for users within their first 30 days

Setup Flow:

* Create a Richmenu configured to switch based on the tag “New joiner in 30 days.”
* Create a segment named “New joiner in 30 days” with a filter: Created within the past 30 days.
* Create a journey:
  * Trigger: Daily at 9:00 AM., Target Segment: “New joiner in 30 days”
  * Action: Add the tag “New joiner in 30 days” to trigger the Richmenu switch.

\[not supported in journey v2.2] User Story 2: Switch Richmenu for users with high purchase potential (PPP)

Setup Flow:

* Create a Richmenu configured to switch based on the tag “High Potential Buyer (PPP).”
* Create a segment named “High Potential Buyer (PPP)” based on purchase prediction logic.
* Create a journey:
  * Trigger: Every Monday at 10:00 AM., Target Segment: “High Potential Buyer (PPP).”
  * Add the tag “High Potential Buyer (PPP)” to switch the Richmenu.
  * Send a reward message (e.g., discount coupon or gift) to incentivize conversion.

A. Join LINE Event Trigger

* **User Story:** As a marketer, I want to trigger a journey the moment a user joins our LINE official account, so that I can immediately engage new followers with a welcome message, an introductory offer, or a guided onboarding experience to improve conversion and retention from the very beginning.
* **How it Works:** When a user adds the brand's LINE Official Account, MAAC receives a "follow event" from LINE. This event immediately triggers the assigned journey for that new follower.
* **Trigger Condition:** The journey is triggered by the "LINE Event - Add Friend" (當聯絡人加入好友).

B. Block LINE Event Trigger

* **User Story:** As a marketer, I want to trigger a journey the moment a user blocks our LINE official account, so that I can automatically reach out via alternative channels like email or SMS. This allows me to understand the reason for their departure through a survey, attempt to win them back with a targeted offer, or simply maintain the customer relationship on a different platform.
* **How it Works:** When a user blocks the LINE Official Account, MAAC receives an "unfollow event". This event triggers a journey for that specific user, enabling follow-up actions on other channels.
* **Trigger Condition:** The journey is triggered by the "LINE Event - Block Friend" (當聯絡人封鎖好友).

| **Target Release Date** | TBD       |

#### Background

In our mission to empower marketers with the most responsive and effective tools, we identified a critical need to bridge the gap between real-time user behavior and automated journey activation<sup>1</sup>. While our GA4 integration provides valuable insights, the inherent data latency can delay crucial marketing responses<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, some enterprise clients have expressed concerns about GA4 access permissions, seeking more direct control over their data sharing<sup>3</sup>.

Journey v2.3 directly addresses these challenges by introducing SDK-powered triggers and actions<sup>4</sup>. This update allows marketers to react instantly to high-intent signals like "add to cart" or "page view" without the typical delays<sup>5</sup>. By enabling immediate and relevant communication, such as abandoned cart reminders, we are not only solving a technical problem but also unlocking one of the most effective e-commerce revenue recovery tactics<sup>6</sup>. This moves MAAC closer to our strategic goal of providing a truly real-time marketing automation platform<sup>7</sup>.

#### Introduction

Journey v2.3: **Real-Time SDK Event Triggers & Retargeting Messages** is a pivotal enhancement that infuses our Journey feature with real-time responsiveness. It introduces two new core capabilities: the ability to trigger and split journeys based on live

**SDK Events** and a new action node to **Send Retargeting Messages**<sup>8</sup>. These features work together to create immediate, behavior-driven experiences that capture customer intent at the most critical moments<sup>99</sup>.

🆚 Optimization for: Real-Time Engagement & Conversion

This update transforms the Journey feature from a scheduled or delayed workflow into a real-time, responsive engine.

| Original Functionality                                     | v2.3 Optimization                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Journey starts based on tags or delayed GA4 events.        | **SDK Event Triggers:** "Act-in-the-moment" activation based on real-time website behaviors like page views, additions to cart, and purchases<sup>101010</sup>.                          |
| Generic messages are sent regardless of immediate context. | **Send Retargeting Message Node:** Dynamically send messages tailored to a user's specific action, such as reminding them of items left in their cart to drive conversions<sup>11</sup>. |

#### Target Audience & Selling Points

**Primary:** E-commerce Managers, Digital Marketers<sup>12</sup>.

**Personas:**

* **"Conversion-Focused Chloe":** Manages online sales and is obsessed with conversion rates and AOV. Her biggest need is to recover abandoned carts and re-engage hesitant shoppers. She values tools that can react instantly to user behavior to close sales.
* **"Data-Driven David":** Focused on creating highly personalized user experiences based on real-time actions. His biggest need is to move beyond batch-and-blast campaigns and implement true 1:1 communication. He wants to trigger unique flows the second a user shows interest on the website.

**Needs & Pains:**

* **Pain:** Losing sales because abandoned cart reminders are sent too late due to data delays. **Need:** An instant, automated way to re-engage users who abandon their carts<sup>1313</sup>.
* **Pain:** Inability to personalize journeys based on immediate on-site behavior. **Need:** A method to trigger different campaign paths in real-time based on which pages a user visits or what actions they take<sup>14</sup>.

**Selling Points:**

| Feature                      | Pain Point Solved                                                         | Product Feature Value (The Pitch)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SDK Event Trigger/Split**  | "By the time I know a user has visited a key page, they're already gone." | **Capture Intent Instantly:** "Trigger or split journeys the moment a user views a product, adds to their cart, or makes a purchase. Stop waiting for data to sync and start personalizing their experience in real-time based on their live behavior." <sup>15</sup> |
| **Send Retargeting Message** | "I'm losing too much revenue from abandoned carts every month."           | **Recover Lost Sales Automatically:** "Send a perfectly timed reminder to users who leave items in their cart. Our retargeting node makes it effortless to bring shoppers back to complete their purchase, boosting your conversion rates." <sup>16</sup>             |

#### Combine Feature

* **Real-Time Personalization Flow:** Use the **SDK Event Trigger** to start a journey the moment a user views a specific product page. If they don't add the item to their cart within a set time, use the **Send Retargeting Message** node to send them a message with a special offer for that exact product, creating a powerful, real-time retargeting funnel.

#### Product Value and Differentiation

Our key differentiator is providing a seamless, real-time solution within the MAAC ecosystem that addresses both data latency and permission concerns<sup>17</sup>. While competitors may offer event-based triggers, our native SDK integration ensures the fastest possible response time, moving beyond the limitations of GA4-based actions<sup>18</sup>. This allows for more effective conversion recovery and a more genuinely real-time personalization experience for our clients.

#### Instruction Manual

All features are configured directly within the Journey canvas UI.

* **To configure an SDK Event Trigger:**
  1. In the Journey Builder, select the trigger node.
  2. Choose "SDK Event" as the trigger type<sup>19</sup>.
  3. From the dropdown, select the desired event (page\_view, add\_to\_cart, purchase) to start the journey<sup>20</sup>.
* **To configure a Send Retargeting Message Action:**
  1. Add an action node to your journey canvas.
  2. Select "Send Retargeting Message" as the action type<sup>21</sup>.
  3. Configure the message content within the MAAC message editor, which can include details about the items left in their cart<sup>222222</sup>.

#### Note & FAQ

**Note**

* **Data Source Priority:** If a client has both GA4 and SDK integrations, the SDK event will be the default choice for real-time triggers, though this can be adjusted within the journey settings<sup>23</sup>.
* **Real-Time Execution:** Journeys triggered by SDK events will start for the user in real-time as the action occurs on the website<sup>24</sup>.
* **Message Content:** The retargeting message content is configurable using the standard MAAC message editor<sup>25</sup>.

**FAQ**

* **Q: Why should I use SDK events instead of GA4 events?**
  * **A:** SDK events offer a real-time advantage by firing instantly, which is crucial for time-sensitive actions like abandoned cart reminders<sup>26</sup>. They also provide clients with more direct control over the data shared with MAAC, addressing potential GA4 permission concerns<sup>27</sup>.
* **Q: Can I filter which page views trigger a journey?**
  * **A:** In this version, the trigger is for the general page\_view event. The ability to filter based on specific event properties (like URL) is a future consideration<sup>28</sup>.
* **Q: Can I set a delay on the retargeting message?**
  * **A:** Yes, you can configure delivery conditions such as delaying the message (e.g., "send 2 hours after abandonment") or sending it only during specific time windows<sup>29</sup>.

#### Setting (For CSM)

* **To Enable for a Customer:** The client must have the MAAC SDK implemented on their website. Ensure their plan includes the advanced Journey feature set.
* **Setup Guide:** For a detailed walkthrough on implementing the SDK and setting up the first retargeting journey, please refer to the CSM Technical Playbook: \[Link to CSM Playbook Document].

## Journey v2.X

**Granular Targeting with GA4 Custom Event Triggers** Unlock hyper-specific, behavior-driven journeys by leveraging a wider range of GA4 events, from content engagement to form submissions.

| **PM Owner**            | **Lydia Hou** |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| **Product**             | MAAC          |
| **Region**              | All           |
| **Target Release Date** | TBD           |

#### Background

While v2.3 introduced real-time capabilities with the SDK, many clients heavily rely on their existing GA4 setup for comprehensive web analytics. To deepen our integration and unlock more sophisticated marketing scenarios without requiring immediate SDK adoption, this version focuses on expanding our Journey triggers to support a wider range of standard and custom GA4 events. By leveraging detailed GA4 events like scroll depth, form\_submit, and specific click actions, we empower marketers to create highly contextual and behavior-driven journeys. This allows them to react to nuanced user interest signals—such as deep engagement with a page or interaction with specific UI elements—and to seamlessly connect website form submissions with conversational follow-ups in LINE.

#### Introduction

Journey v2.4: **Granular Targeting with GA4 Custom Event Triggers** moves beyond basic e-commerce events to capture the full spectrum of user engagement signals available in GA4. This update introduces a new suite of trigger and split conditions, allowing marketers to design campaigns that respond to subtle but significant user behaviors.

🆚 **Optimization for: Behavioral Targeting & Deeper Personalization** This update transforms the Journey feature from reacting to broad events to responding to specific, nuanced user interactions.

| **Original Functionality**                                            | **v2.4 Optimization**                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Journey triggers based on broad e-commerce events (e.g., purchase).   | **GA4 Custom Event Triggers:** "Read-the-intent" activation based on specific behaviors like scroll depth, form submissions, or clicks on particular elements.                            |
| Segmentation is primarily based on user attributes or past purchases. | **Behavior-Driven Segmentation:** Create dynamic segments based on a user's real-time engagement with content and UI elements, identifying interest before a purchase is even considered. |

#### Target Audience & Selling Points

**Primary:** Digital Marketers, Content Marketers, CRM Specialists.

**Personas:**

* **"Content-Focused Carla":** Manages the company blog and resources. Her biggest need is to identify highly engaged readers and nurture them toward conversion. She wants to know who reads articles to the end and which content drives leads.
* **"Data-Driven David":** Focused on creating a seamless omnichannel experience. His biggest need is to connect website interactions (like filling out a form) with immediate, personalized follow-ups in other channels like LINE.

**Needs & Pains:**

* **Pain:** Treating all website visitors the same, unable to distinguish between a casual browser and a highly interested prospect who reads an entire page. **Need:** A way to trigger different journeys based on the depth of content engagement.
* **Pain:** A disconnect between website lead generation (forms) and the communication channel (LINE), causing delayed and impersonal follow-ups. **Need:** A method to instantly trigger a LINE conversation or add a tag the moment a form is submitted.

**Selling Points:**

| **Feature**              | **Pain Point Solved**                                    | **Product Feature Value (The Pitch)**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **scroll Depth Trigger** | "I can't tell who's _really_ reading my content."        | **Reward Deep Engagement:** "Identify your most interested prospects by triggering journeys for users who scroll 90% of the way down a page. Nurture their high intent with targeted follow-ups and special offers."  |
| **form\_submit Trigger** | "My follow-up on web form leads is too slow and manual." | **Connect Web Forms to LINE Instantly:** "Turn a static form submission into an immediate conversation. Trigger a personalized welcome journey or a live agent notification on LINE the moment a user hits 'submit'." |
| **click Event Trigger**  | "My website personalization is generic."                 | **Target Based on Precise Interest:** "Launch a tailored journey when a user clicks a specific button or link, like 'Recommendations for 18-25'. Go beyond page views to understand true user intent."                |

#### Combine Feature

* **Content-to-Conversion Funnel:** Use the **scroll** trigger on a blog post to identify engaged readers. Add a **"Highly Engaged" tag** (from v2.2) to these users. If they later visit the pricing page, use the **page\_view** trigger to send a message offering a personalized demo.

#### Product Value and Differentiation

Our key differentiator is moving beyond the standard e-commerce funnel events (add\_to\_cart, purchase). By integrating with a wider array of GA4 events, we empower marketers to engage with customers at every stage of their lifecycle—from initial interest (scroll, click) to lead generation (form\_submit) and retention (session\_start). This provides a much richer, more holistic view of the customer than competitors who focus solely on transactional events.

#### Instruction Manual

Configuration is done directly within the Journey canvas UI.

1. In the Journey Builder, select a Trigger or Split node.
2. Choose "GA4 Event" as the type.
3. A dropdown will now show an expanded list of events, including click, form\_submit, scroll, etc.
4. Select the desired event.
5. Configure the specific parameters for that event (e.g., enter "90" for percent\_scrolled, or the form\_id for a form\_submit).

#### Note & FAQ

**Note**

* **Custom Event Setup:** To use the add\_to\_wishlist trigger, the client must have already implemented this custom event in their own GA4 setup. The feature relies on the client's existing tracking.
* **Parameter-Based Triggering:** The power of these new triggers lies in their parameters. Encourage clients to use specific form\_ids or link\_classes for the most granular control.

**FAQ**

* **Q: Do I need to change my website's GA4 setup to use this?**
  * **A:** For standard events like scroll or page\_view, no changes are needed. To use triggers based on custom events like add\_to\_wishlist or specific form\_ids, you must ensure those events and parameters are being correctly sent to GA4 from your website.
* **Q: How is this different from the v2.3 SDK events?**
  * **A:** SDK events (v2.3) are for **real-time** actions and require separate implementation, making them ideal for time-sensitive triggers like abandoned carts. These GA4 events (v2.4) leverage the rich **analytics data you already have**, allowing for more complex behavioral segmentation, though they are subject to GA4's standard data processing latency.
* **Q: Can I trigger a journey based on a click on&#x20;**_**any**_**&#x20;button?**
  * **A:** You can trigger it based on any click that your GA4 is tracking with identifiable parameters, like a unique link\_url or link\_class. The more specific your GA4 event tracking is, the more targeted your journeys can be.

#### Setting (For CSM)

* **To Enable for a Customer:** This feature is available to all clients with a GA4 integration. No special backend settings are required.
* **Setup Guide:** Proactively ask clients about their key website interactions. Review their GA4 event setup to identify opportunities. Suggest journey ideas based on their existing tracking (e.g., "I see you have a 'Request a Quote' form; let's build a journey to instantly follow up with those leads on LINE.").

* 每個帳戶最多可同時運行 350 組旅程
* 每個旅程最多設定 30 個節點（包含出口）
* **貼標籤觸發條件**：每位聯絡人每小時僅能觸發一次
* **GA 行為觸發條件**：每位聯絡人每 24 小時僅能觸發一次
* **分眾更新與觸發時間說明**：系統只會在你設定的「**排程觸發日**」當天凌晨更新分眾名單，並於指定時間根據**當日更新後的分眾名單**啟動旅程。如果有聯絡人是在該日凌晨更新後（例如早上 10 點）才符合條件並進入分眾，**他們將不會參與當天的旅程觸發**，而是要等到**下一次排程日**才會執行。👉 **提醒：** 為了讓聯絡人能順利啟動旅程，他們必須**在分眾更新前就已符合條件並加入分眾**。
* **標籤新增與移除限制**：每次操作最多可新增或移除 5 個標籤，當聯絡人同時被貼上多個標籤（如 tagA、tagB、tagC），系統\*\*無法保證貼標順序。\*\*👉 **提醒：** 若有貼標順序需求，建議調整流程，避免同時貼上多個標籤。

**Segment Update & Trigger Timing:**

The system updates the segment list at midnight on the scheduled trigger day. The journey will then start at the specified time using the updated segment list from that morning.

If a contact only meets the segment conditions after the midnight update (e.g., at 10:00 AM), they will not be included in that day’s journey trigger. Instead, they will be included in the next scheduled trigger.

👉 **Reminder:** To ensure contacts are included in the journey, they must meet the segment criteria **before** the segment is updated at midnight.

**Tag Add/Remove Limitations:**

Each action can add or remove **up to 5 tags** per contact. When applying multiple tags (e.g., tagA, tagB, tagC), the system **does not guarantee the tag order**.

👉 **Reminder:** If a specific tag order is required, we recommend adjusting your flow to avoid applying multiple tags at once.

**การอัปเดตเซกเมนต์และเวลาเริ่ม Journey:**

ระบบจะอัปเดตรายชื่อในเซกเมนต์ในช่วงเที่ยงคืนของวันที่คุณตั้งไว้ให้เป็นวันเริ่มต้น เมื่อถึงเวลาที่กำหนด ระบบจะเริ่ม Journey โดยอิงจากรายชื่อเซกเมนต์ที่อัปเดตไว้ในตอนเช้า

หากมีผู้ติดต่อที่เข้าตรงเงื่อนไข **หลังจากเที่ยงคืนของวันนั้น** (เช่น เวลา 10:00 น.) พวกเขาจะ **ไม่ถูกรวมใน Journey ของวันนั้น** และจะต้องรอจนถึงวันถัดไปที่มีการตั้งเวลาไว้

👉 **แจ้งเตือน:** เพื่อให้ผู้ติดต่อถูกเริ่ม Journey ได้ตามปกติ พวกเขาต้องเข้าเงื่อนไขและอยู่ในเซกเมนต์ **ก่อนถึงเวลาอัปเดตเซกเมนต์ตอนเที่ยงคืน**

**ข้อจำกัดในการเพิ่ม/ลบแท็ก:**

ระบบรองรับการเพิ่มหรือลบแท็ก **ได้สูงสุด 5 แท็กต่อครั้ง** และหากมีการเพิ่มหลายแท็กพร้อมกัน (เช่น tagA, tagB, tagC) ระบบจะ **ไม่สามารถรับประกันลำดับของแท็กได้**

👉 **แจ้งเตือน:** หากจำเป็นต้องกำหนดลำดับแท็ก แนะนำให้ปรับขั้นตอนเพื่อหลีกเลี่ยงการเพิ่มหลายแท็กในคราวเดียว

## Appendix: Journey High-Level Spec \[2025.06]

### 1. Overview

本文件主要在說明 MAAC Journey 功能從 2025 Q2 起的策略方向與 high-level spec。希望透過此文件對齊我們「為何而做 (Why)」以及各階段的「里程碑 (Milestones)」，確保團隊專注於為客戶創造最大價值，並達成短中長期的商業目標。

#### 核心策略

我們的策略是將 Journey 從現有的單一渠道工具，逐步演化為一個由 AI 驅動的全渠道行銷自動化平台 (Omnichannel Marketing Automation platform powered by AI) 。 我們將依循 **「追趕 (Catchup) -> 優化 (Better) -> 差異化 (Different) -> 創新 (New)」** 的路徑 ，短期內補足市場基礎功能以防止客戶流失 ，中長期則透過 LINE 的深度整合 與 AI 創新 來獲取新客戶，建立市場領導地位。

### 2. 優先性評估 - 行銷情境分析

為了有效分配資源，我們根據「客戶發送訊息量」、「替客戶增加營收」與「工程 Effort」三個維度，評估了不同行銷情境的優先級。這將指導我們各季度的開發順序。

### 4. High-Level Spec (v2.1 - v3.5)

#### 25' Q2: Quick Wins (v2.1)

**v2.1: Node Performance (節點成效分析)**

* **TA:** 行銷人員、CRM 專員 (Marketers, CRM Specialists) 。
* **對客戶的價值 (Customer Value):** 解決了長期以來無法衡量各節點成效的痛點 。讓行銷人員能清楚看見每一步的表現，了解用戶如何與旅程互動，並找出可優化的瓶頸 。
* **對漸強的價值 (Business Value):**
  * **防止流失 (Churn Prevention):** 這是客戶長期許願的基礎功能 (Table stakes) ，滿足此需求能提升客戶滿意度，穩固現有客群 。
  * **奠定基礎:** 為未來更多、更複雜的優化功能（如 AI 優化建議）提供必要的數據基礎。
* **Why doing this:** 這是客戶呼聲最高的功能之一 ，也是所有優化的基礎。若無法衡量成效，客戶就無法得知 Journey 的價值，也無法找出瓶頸以進行優化。這是一個能快速提供價值、滿足客戶基本分析需求的 Quick Win，有助於提升客戶滿意度並鞏固現有客群。
* **What to build:**
  * **全面的節點數據：** 在 Journey 畫布的各個節點上，需清楚顯示關鍵成效指標。這包括：觸發人數、訊息發送數、開啟數、點擊數，以及在客戶有購買 GA 模組的情況下的訂單與營收數據 。
  * **不同節點的專屬指標：** 需根據節點類型提供對應指標，例如「觸發節點」顯示觸發總數，「GA 事件節點」顯示對應的事件計數（如加入購物車次數），而「發送訊息節點」則顯示完整的互動指標 。
  * **清晰的流程分佈：** 在分支節點上，需明確顯示進入各個分支路徑的用戶百分比，幫助行銷人員直觀地理解受眾的分流情況 。
  * **範疇說明 (Scope Clarification)：** 根據內部討論，此版本將專注於提供節點「當下」的整體表現，而非趨勢分析 。因此，v2.1 將 **不包含** 時間區間篩選功能 。我們的判斷是，進階的趨勢分析應在未來的報表或 AI 洞察功能中實現，以保持此版本功能的單純與易用性 。

#### 25' Q3: 滿足核心需求 (v2.2, v2.3, v2.4, v2.x)

**v2.2: Time-based Automation & Tagging （可以 unblock 日本 Segment-based Rich Menu 的需求）**

* **TA:** 行銷人員、CRM 專員 。
* **對客戶的價值 (Customer Value):** 解決「觸發條件不靈活」的問題 ，實現精準、彈性的排程 。讓行銷人員可以自動化執行節慶行銷、生日祝福等有時效性的溝通 ，並透過貼標籤對用戶進行分類，為後續的個人化行銷做準備 。
* **對漸強的價值 (Business Value):**
  * **防止流失 (Churn Prevention):** 滿足客戶對於基礎 MA 功能的強烈需求 ，提升產品黏性。
  * **向上銷售 (Upsell):** 讓客戶能實現更多元的行銷場景 ，加深對產品的依賴，創造潛在的升級機會。
* **Why doing this:** 解鎖市場上最基礎也最關鍵的自動化行銷場景，是客戶的迫切需求。目前產品在這塊的缺口是導致客戶無法深度使用的原因之一。「貼標籤」則是實現後續分眾與個人化的最基本 Action，也是客戶強烈要求的功能。
* **What to build:**
  * **彈性的時間觸發器 (Time-based Trigger)：** 讓行銷人員能夠精準安排行銷活動。這包括兩種主要情境：
    * **單次觸發：** 如設定在黑色星期五當天凌晨 00:00 準時發送優惠訊息 。
    * **週期性觸發：** 如設定每週一早上 9:00 發送週報，或每月 1 號發送會員權益通知 。
  * **動態的貼標籤動作 (Add/Remove Tag Action)：** 在 Journey 流程中新增「新增/移除標籤」的動作節點。這讓行銷人員可以根據用戶在旅程中的行為，即時為其貼上或移除標籤（例如：用戶若在旅程中點擊了某個特定優惠，就為他貼上「對A產品感興趣」的標籤），以便後續進行更精準的溝通 。

**v2.3: Basic Retargeting**

* **TA:** 以電商、零售業的行銷人員為主，同時適用於所有類型的行銷人員 。
* **對客戶的價值 (Customer Value):** 實現高價值的「行為再行銷」，例如對加入購物車但未結帳的顧客自動發送提醒，有效提升轉換率。滿足客戶對「根據用戶行為觸發旅程」的核心需求 。
* **對漸強的價值 (Business Value):**
  * **防止流失 (Churn Prevention):** 這是 MA 市場的標準功能，補足此能力缺口，避免客戶因功能不足而轉向競品 。
  * **獲取新客 (New Customer Acquisition):** 具備電商核心的再行銷功能，能有力地吸引並贏得電商與零售產業的新客戶。
* **Why doing this:** 為了切入佔我們客戶一半的電商核心場景，我們必須提供網站再行銷能力。這是客戶需求列表中「根據行為觸發旅程」的核心應用 。透過 Web SDK 事件觸發，我們能解鎖如購物車放棄、瀏覽商品未購買等高價值情境，直接幫助客戶提升營收，同時補足與競品的差距。
* **What to build:**
  * **行為事件觸發器 (Web SDK Event Trigger)：** 新增「Web SDK 事件」作為旅程的觸發器。
  * **具體應用場景：** 這將能實現如「當用戶將商品加入購物車後 3 小時仍未結帳，則自動觸發一個提醒訊息的旅程」或「當用戶連續三天瀏覽特定類別的商品後，觸發一個相關商品的推薦旅程」。
  * **行為判斷規則 (Behavior-based Rule)：** 支援以 Web SDK 傳送的事件屬性（如：商品名稱、金額）作為分支判斷條件，實現更細緻的流程分歧。

**v2.4: TBD (CDH trigger or time-reminder)**

* CDH trigger 也許會拆成不同 phase

#### 25' Q3/Q4: 擴展渠道 (v2.5+)

**v2.5: Multi-Channel Expansion (2nd channel)**

* **TA:** 所有行銷人員，特別是希望整合線上線下顧客溝通，或觸及非 LINE 使用者的品牌 。
* **對客戶的價值 (Customer Value):** 解決「只能使用單一渠道」的限制 ，讓品牌能透過顧客偏好的渠道與他們互動，實現無縫的全渠道溝通，處理更多元的行銷場景 。
* **對漸強的價值 (Business Value):**
  * **防止流失 & 獲取新客:** 這是最重要的策略之一。補足與競品的渠道差距，是防止客戶流失的關鍵 。同時，這讓我們能真正切入 MA 市場，贏得更多元的客戶，爭取其行銷自動化預算 。
  * **向上銷售 (Upsell):** 新渠道的整合與使用量，可作為加值服務或方案升級的機會點 。
* **Why doing this:** 我們的競爭對手大多已具備多渠道能力，這是市場的標準配備 。補足此差距是防止客戶因功能不足而流失的關鍵 。我們的策略是以 LINE 為核心，讓其他渠道輔助，實現「LINE-centric」的跨渠道溝通，而非單純疊加渠道 。
* **What to build:**
  * **新渠道整合 (New Channel Integration)：** 整合第二個渠道 (Roadmap 規劃為 WhatsApp) ，並建立可擴展的底層架構，以便未來能更快速地增加第三方渠道。

**v2.x: Multi-Channel Expansion (2nd+ channel) \[Q4+]**

* **What to build:**
  * **策略性渠道應用：** 新渠道的價值在於與 LINE 協作。例如，我們可以設計一個旅程，先透過 SMS 發送優惠碼來吸引新用戶，引導他們加入 LINE 好友以獲得更完整的服務，從而將公域流量轉化為私域流量。
  * **Candidates**
    * SMS
    * EDM
    * WebChat
    * And more

#### 25' Q4: 導入 AI 差異化 (v3.0)

**v3.0: AI-Assisted Creation**

* **TA:** 所有行銷人員，特別是對於從零開始規劃複雜旅程感到困難，或需要快速產出大量行銷文案的用戶 。
* **對客戶的價值 (Customer Value):** 直接解決「旅程設定複雜且耗時」的痛點 。透過 AI 協助，能更輕鬆、快速地完成設定 ，節省大量手動規劃與撰寫文案的時間，讓行銷人員更有效率 。
* **對漸強的價值 (Business Value):**
  * **市場差異化 & 獲取新客:** 這是我們「AI-first」策略的第一步，是我們與競品的關鍵差異化特色 。一個創新的、易於使用的 AI 功能，將成為吸引新客戶的強大賣點。
  * **向上銷售 & 鞏固未來 (Upsell & Secure Future):** AI 將是我們獨特的價值主張，為未來的方案升級與加值服務提供基礎，鞏固市場領導地位 。
* **Why doing this:** 這是我們「AI-first」策略的第一步。傳統的 Journey 建置與內容撰寫流程對許多行銷人員來說依然複雜且耗時。我們的策略是，當 AI 能提供比傳統方式（如：制式模板）更優越的體驗時，就優先採用 AI 方案 。透過 AI Copilot，我們能將體驗提升一個檔次，從「工具」進化為「智慧夥伴」，這將是我們超越競品、吸引新客戶的關鍵差異化特色 。
* **What to build:**
  * **AI Journey Generation (AI 旅程生成)：** 開發一個「AI Copilot」介面，讓使用者透過自然語言或點選目標（如：「為我的美妝品牌建立一個提升會員回購率的旅程」）來自動生成一個包含觸發、判斷、與訊息節點的旅程草稿，解決從零到一的規劃難題 。
  * **AI Content Generation (AI 內容生成)：** 在「發送訊息」節點中，嵌入 AI 文案生成器。行銷人員只需輸入產品或活動關鍵字，AI 就能根據行銷目標（如：新品宣傳、優惠提醒）自動撰寫多版本、個人化的訊息內容，大幅提升內容產能與創意 。

**Appendix: Tech feasibility study & Design patterns**

## Appendix: AI Journey overview- for Tech feasibility study & Design prototyping \[2025.08]

## AI Journey Overview：下一代的 Customer Engagement Platform

#### 1. Why it's important? 為什麼這個方向很重要？

行銷自動化市場競爭激烈，客戶對高效、個人化的多渠道互動有著迫切需求。如果我們的 Journey 功能無法進化，將難以滿足客戶的基本需求並有效擴展，最終可能在競爭中落後。

#### 2. Why now? 為什麼現在是關鍵時刻？

我們現有的 LINE CRM tool 已面臨瓶頸，導致客戶流失。然而，AI 技術的成熟為我們提供了關鍵機會。現在正是邁向下一代 AI 驅動的多渠道 CEP 解決方案的最佳時機，不僅是為了填補現有功能缺口，更是要透過創新，在市場上實現彎道超車。

#### 3. How to win? 我們的致勝策略是什麼？

* **追趕 (Catchup):**
  * **快速補足渠道：** 迅速新增如 WhatsApp、SMS、EDM 等多個渠道，滿足市場基礎需求。
  * **提供快速價值：** 透過優化成效分析與進階 triggers，為客戶提供立竿見影的價值，減少客戶流失。
* **優化 (Better):**
  * **以 LINE 為核心：** 強化我們在 LINE 上的獨特優勢，將 LINE 作為多渠道策略的核心。其他渠道將作為輔助，協助將用戶導回 LINE 生態，或彌補 LINE 在特定溝通情境下的不足。
* **差異化 (Different):**
  * **雙向互動旅程：** 結合 MAAC (行銷自動化) 與 CAAC (對話式 AI)，創造獨一無二的雙向對話旅程，打破傳統行銷單向發送的模式。例如，可根據客服對話內容觸發關懷旅程，或推薦用戶曾提及的商品。
* **創新 (New):**
  * **AI-First 原則：** 優先將 AI 應用於行銷自動化的核心痛點。當 AI 解決方案能提供比傳統方案更好的體驗時，我們將毫不猶豫地採用。例如，使用「AI Copilot」來自動生成旅程，大幅提升效率與客製化程度。或是與 DAAC 結合，實現 Insight to action 的迴路。

#### 4. What to build? 我們的產品藍圖

根據我們的核心策略，這是我們預計的產品功能演進藍圖。我們將致力於提供：**更多的渠道節點 (channel node)、更多的資料事件觸發器 (data event triggers)、更多的動作節點 (action node) 以及強大的 AI 內容與旅程生成功能，以及 AI insight (powered by DAAC)。**

* **短期 (2025 Q2 - Q3):** **基礎功能強化 ＆ 基礎多渠道追趕**
  * **節點成效分析：** 讓行銷人員能清楚衡量每個節點的表現，找出優化瓶頸。
  * **more triggers：** 引入基於 時間 和網站行為的觸發器（Web SDK 事件），解鎖節慶行銷與高價值的再行銷情境。
  * **more actions**: add tag/ remove tag
  * **基礎多渠道追趕：** 整合 SMS（ 2025/10 ）、EDM（ 2025/10 ） 等渠道，補足市場功能缺口，鞏固現有客群並獲取新客戶。

→ 主要是防守（e.g.: beBit）與 new deals (尚未採用 LINE CRM tool or MA 的客戶）

* **中期 (2025 Q4):** **AI 導入 ＆ 多渠道擴展**
  * **AI 輔助創作：** 透過 **AI Journey Generation (AI 旅程生成)** 和 **AI Content Generation (AI 內容生成)**，大幅降低設計複雜旅程和撰寫文案的時間與門檻，建立市場差異化。
  * **Insight to action：** 開發 **AI Performance Optimizer**，自動分析旅程瓶頸並提供優化建議，並強調與 DAAC 的合作。
  * \*\*more triggers：\*\*CDH data event
  * **多渠道擴展：** 持續拓展新渠道，例如 Web channel。

→ 主要著重在 Upsell 與 New deals，希望透過 AI 多渠道 Journey，吸引既有顧客升級，或者是吸引新客購買。

* **長期 (2026 H1):** **加強市場差異化 ＆AI 驅動的自主優化與預測**
  * **雙向對話**：透過 AI Journey 觸發 CAAC Agents（AI or Human），達成行銷轉客服諮詢、銷售諮詢的情境。
  * **智慧派送與分眾：** 實現 **AI Smart Sending & Routing**，自動選擇最佳發送時間與渠道；並透過 **AI Smart Segmentation & Intent Detection** 智慧分眾與偵測用戶意圖，精準觸發旅程。
  * **多渠道擴展：** 持續拓展新渠道，例如 WhatsApp。

→ 待功能逐漸完備，可思考如何去搶 MA/ CEP 的單（已經有在使用 MA or CEP 的顧客），需思考如何幫助客戶無痛轉移。

**產品組合**

* MAAC Journey alone: 主打 mid-level clients，好用容易上手的 AI MA 工具。
* MAAC Journey + CAAC：主打行銷客服銷售一條龍，好用容易上手的 AI CEP 工具。
* MAAC Journey + DAAC：主打 mid-large level clients，強調可以透過 data 整合提供 insight，實現 insight to action 的自動化迴路。

####

#### 5. What's next?

**5.1 Technical stack upgrade**

隨著 AI Journey 上線

* 有 AI journey creation，會有更多 Journey 被建立
* 會有更多元的 events trigger (SDK events, GA4, CDH data)，造就更多 active journey
* 會有更多渠道，帶來更多 traffic

綜合以上，我們預估其使用量將有 20-50 倍的顯著成長：

* 使用 Journey 的組織數成長 5 倍。
* 每個組織平均活躍 Journey 數達到 15-20 個。
* 每個活躍 Journey 每天的流量達到數十到數百次。

且因為有 AI insight，Journey 會被更頻繁地檢視與更新。

為了應對這股爆發性的成長，我們必須對前端與後端 tech stack 進行升級。

* 能夠支援頻繁調整的 FE components
* 能夠支援多元數據且更大流量的 BE infra
* 能夠成為 AI 能夠理解的 Journey 語意結構 (AI journey creation, Insight to action by DAAC)

**5.2 New design patterns & components (新設計模式與元件)**

為了實現從「工具」到「智慧夥伴」的轉變，我們需要開發新的設計模式與元件：

* **從 UI 到 AI UX (AI Copilot):** 介面設計需能無縫整合 AI 互動，讓用戶能透過自然語言高效地與 AI 協作，完成旅程設計。
* **令人信賴的 AI**：提供使用者為什麼 AI 產生這樣的旅程設計或建議，讓用戶更能理解 AI，進而相信 AI
* **Insight to Action (AI Agent):** 建立能將 AI 洞察 (Insight) 直接轉化為優化行動 (Action) 的設計模式，例如在 report 上直接呈現優化建議，並提供一鍵套用的功能。

**5.3 Pricing discussions**

* MAAC 從 LINE 為主的 MA，變成多渠道 MA 的價值 → 調整價格
* AI 加值的價值有多大？是不是跟 DAAC 定價會有關？

#### Eng 提問 @ DDL: 08/13

1. 以目前的 journey 的 capacity 來說 (800 RPS)，20倍的流量大概是坐落 16K RPS，以我們目前 **end-to-end latency 目標低於 5 秒而言**，這代表：
2. segment-based trigger (segment & AI insight to action) 不限速的情境下，瞬間觸發不得超過 80K 。
3. segment-based trigger 限速 (每秒放2K, 符合 Line API 的限制) 的情境下，可以支援 8 位客戶同時使用此類型的 journey 操作。

從此推算，**Journey 流量優化的目標取決於”在限速的情境下，產品期望同時觸發 segment-based trigger 的客戶數量“**。

* 20倍 -> 8 位 (短期)
* 100倍 -> 40 位 (中期)
* 1000倍 -> 400 位 (長期)

**(2) DAAC embedded in MAAC –**[**Ronald Yeh**](mailto:ronald.yeh@cresclab.com)\*\*\*\*

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (92)>)

📈 核心價值與目標 (High-Level Value & Goal)

**Goal: Leverage DAAC agent to revamp MAAC data value**

對 MAAC 用戶而言，這代表他們不再需要花費數小時人工分析報表、猜測數據背後的意義 (Ref: DAAC - Pitch Feedback - pitch feedback.csv)。DAAC 將直接在 MAAC 介面中，告訴他們「發生了什麼」、「為什麼重要」，以及「下一步該怎麼做」

**Phase 1: 短期 (Short Term) — 嵌入式洞察 (Embedded Insights)**

🎯 階段目標：實現「原地有感」，快速驗證價值 此階段的戰略重點是\*\*「驗證價值」\*\*。在客戶不動、數據不搬的情況下，證明 DAAC 的 AI 洞察優於人工分析。

**1. 核心功能 (The "Teaser" content)**

* AI 總結 (AI Summary): MAAC 儀表板與週報的 AI 總結。
* 關鍵洞察 (Key Insight): AI 主動從數據中挖掘的「最關鍵洞察」。
* 產業標竿 (Industry Benchmark): 提供匿名數據的產業均值（如好友封鎖率），這是客戶高度渴求的價值點 (Ref: DAAC market feedback collect - TW Pitch.csv - 漸強實驗室 feedback)。

**2. 部署場景 (The "Where")**

* MAAC 數據洞察子頁面： 靜態展示，作為價值錨點。
* 週報 EDM： 主動推送，證明 AI 能自動化彙報。
* 主動 DAAC 警示 (Proactive DAAC Alert): 當 AI 偵測到關鍵指標異常（如：封鎖率激增、某 Journey 轉換率暴跌），立即透過 MAAC 既有通知中心發送警示。這是從「被動洞察」到「主動預警」的第一步。

**3. PoC 驗證計劃 (The "Proof")**

* 人機協同 (Human-in-the-Loop)： 初期由 PM/Data Team 驗證 AI 洞察品質，確保商業邏輯無誤，再推送給 Pilot 客戶，refer to Journey phase 1 。
* API 規格化： DAAC (Backend) 與 MAAC (Frontend) 需定義標準化的 Insight API Response Format。

**成功指標 (Metrics)：**

* refer to Journey phase 1 & 2

**Phase 2: 中期 (Mid Term) — 脈絡感知 AI 助理 (Contextual AI Assistant)**

🎯 階段目標：實現「隨處可問」，深化互動價值 此階段的戰略重點是\*\*「深化互動」\*\*。我們從「靜態推送」升級為「動態對話」，讓 DAAC Agent 成為 MAAC 使用者隨手可及的「AI 副駕 (Co-pilot)」。

**1. 核心功能 (The "Co-pilot")**

* Data Agent Chatbox：
  * 以 DAAC Studio 閹割版 (Lite) 為核心，透過 iframe 嵌入 MAAC。專注於文字互動，降低初期工程複雜度 (閹割版文字互動為主，無互動性圖表、離線檔案上傳)
  * 脈絡感知 (Context-Aware)：Chatbox 必須能自動讀取當前頁面/儀表板卡片的 Context。範例： 當用戶在「LINE 好友增長」卡片旁點擊 Agent，Agent 的預設問題應為「想深入分析好友來源嗎？」

**2. 部署場景 (Entry Points)**

* 數據洞察： 每個 Dashboard Card 旁增加一個 "Ask AI" 圖示。
* MAAC 核心功能旁： Boardcast / Journey / Segment 頁面旁，提供針對性的分析建議。
* 浮動按鈕 (Floating Button)： MAAC 右下角常駐的 Agent chatbox

**3. 邁向「行動護城河」 (Building the "Action Moat")**

* 一鍵行動 (One-Click Action)：Agent 不只提供洞察，更要提供「行動按鈕」。
* 範例 1 (Insight-to-MAAC-Segment)：
  * Agent: 「我發現 3,500 位『近 30 天活躍但未購買』的 VIP 用戶，建議立即再行銷。」
  * Button: \[ 立即於 MAAC 創建此受眾包 ]

**Appendix: MAAC × CAAC 自動化整合三層次**

## Appendix: MAAC × CAAC 自動化整合三層次

### 背景問題

1. **現況**

* MAAC 的**自動回覆**與**自動旅程**，以及 CAAC 的**客服指派**與 **AI agent**，都涉及「自動回覆」與「意圖獲取」。
* 目前初步討論，認為「**釐清意圖**」成為跨產品協作的核心議題：即如何在不同模組間明確定義誰負責理解、識別、回應使用者的意圖。

2. **挑戰**

* 隨著 MAAC 與 CAAC 的整合加深，如果功能邊界模糊，可能造成使用者體驗混淆。
* 跨產品協作缺乏統一邏輯，未來擴展或優化時可能增加溝通與開發成本。

3. **目的**

* 在 POC 階段，先釐清各功能的責任範圍與交互邏輯。
* 明確劃分功能邊界，避免重複或衝突。
* 建立跨產品協作框架，為未來團隊協作與整合提供指引。
* 發揮 MAAC 與 CAAC 的整合綜效，確保整體解決方案的高效與一致性。

4. **與 AI Journey Workflow Engine 的關聯**

* AI journey workflow engine 將成為自動化決策與訊息觸發的中樞，負責串接 MAAC 與 CAAC 的功能模組。
* 在 POC 階段，希望先針對「釐清意圖」有明確的定義與處理方式，可為後續跨產品協作建立清晰的決策規則。

5. **建議 Jalex 思考的面向（供參考）**

* **意圖識別層級**：哪些意圖由 MAAC 處理？哪些由 CAAC 處理？AI journey engine 在其中扮演什麼角色？
* **功能邊界與責任分配**：訊息觸發、回覆生成、routing 與追蹤，各模組的責任如何劃分？
* **跨產品綜效**：如何利用兩個系統的優勢互補，提高自動化效率與使用者體驗一致性？
* **未來擴展性**：為 AI journey 與其他潛在產品模組留出可擴展接口與決策空間。

#### 核心目標區隔

MAAC 和 CAAC 的核心目標不同，這將是我們設計框架的第一層次。

* **MAAC 偏向「主動」**：幫助品牌**推動行銷、促進自動轉換** 。自動旅程裡的回覆，旨在引導用戶進一步行動，例如點擊、購買、註冊 。
* **CAAC service 偏向「被動」**：幫助品牌**解決問題、提升服務效率** 。例如自動指派、AI 客服回覆，都是在回應用戶的需求或問題 。
* **CAAC sales 偏向「主動」**：幫助品牌**主動推薦** 。例如 AI sales agent，發送商品推薦訊息，進行導購 。

**設計原則**：

* 將\*\*「行銷 vs. 服務」\*\*的心態差異作為第一層框架 。
* 當用戶點擊廣告或加入旅程，由 MAAC 主導；
* 當用戶主動開口詢問、抱怨或求助時，或當用戶諮詢商品建議時，則由 CAAC 主導 。

#### 整合與交互設計

MAAC 和 CAAC 的整合將透過 **共用能力層**與 **交互體驗**來實現無縫體驗 。

* **共用能力層**：
  * **意圖辨識 (Intent Detection)**：NLP 和 AI 意圖模型是共用模組 。例如，如果模型辨識出「退貨」意圖，MAAC 旅程就不應該回覆優惠碼，而是將其交由 CAAC 處理 。
  * **資料 Profile 與訊息模板**：客戶資料與訊息內容模板可以共用，避免重複開發 。
* **交互體驗**：
  * **前端無縫切換**：在用戶旅程中，如果偵測到**客服意圖**，系統應能無縫切換到 CAAC 。
  * 反之，在客服回覆中，若有**行銷 follow-up** 機會（例如問題解決後持續再行銷），可以引導回 MAAC 。

### 三個層次（AI 介入程度 vs. 人類控制度）

[Lenny: Why your AI product needs a different development lifecycle](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-your-ai-product-needs-a-different)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (97)>)

#### V1 – Routing (意圖分類 & 分流)

* **特徵**：AI 僅做分類，不解決問題。
* **人類控制度**：高
* **AI 自主性**：低
* **產品實例**：
  * **MAAC**：Auto-reply（按鈕/關鍵字）、Journey branch（設定式分支路徑）
  * **CAAC**：Rule-based routing（關鍵字或規則將客服單分派到對應部門/人員）

#### V2 – Copilot (輔助回覆 & 建議)

* **特徵**：AI 給予輔助資訊，由人類決定是否採納。
* **人類控制度**：中
* **AI 自主性**：中
* **產品實例**：
  * **MAAC**：AI co-pilot（幫助行銷人員規劃旅程或建議回覆內容）
  * **CAAC**：AI co-pilot（提供知識庫內容、SOP、過去案例，加速客服回覆）
  * **DAAC**（後續延伸）：AI co-pilot 協助數據分析與決策

#### V3 – Resolution Assistant (AI 自主解決)

* **特徵**：AI 直接處理、回覆並完成互動，人類僅介入例外情況。
* **人類控制度**：低
* **AI 自主性**：高
* **產品實例**：
  * **CAAC**：AI Customer Service Agent（解決常見客服問題）
  * **CAAC**：AI Shopping/Sales Agent（引導轉單、加購）

### 層次之間的關係與順序

實務上，使用者流程 **不是線性 v1 → v2 → v3**，而是多種組合：

1. **v3 → v2**

* 先由 AI Agent 嘗試解決（v3）
* 若 AI 判斷信心不足或複雜問題，再交給 Copilot（v2）協助人工完成。

2. **v1 → v3 → v2**

* 先透過簡單規則分流（v1）
* 分流後交由 AI Agent 嘗試處理（v3）
* 若無法完整解決，再由 Copilot（v2）輔助人工。

### AI Journey POC - MAAC x CAAC 重點

以 MAAC X CAAC 情境上，要驗證以下的路有通

* Expected Input
  * Profile Data：潛在客戶 Profil
  * Engagement Data：與哪則訊息互動、互動內容、互動時間
  * \--> Journey path summary
* Expected Output
  * 根據收集到的資料 Context
  * CAAC AI Agent 主動與用戶對話 - 互動完成後，同步將互動資料拋回給 MAAC Journey

**小結：**

* 三層次模型幫助我們釐清「AI 自主性 vs 人類控制度」的不同階段，並說明 **MAAC 與 CAAC 應如何分工與銜接**。
* 未來整合的核心在於 **共用意圖判斷層**，再透過優先級 routing 設計，讓 **前台體驗一致，後台分工清楚**。

### 流程圖示意（概念版）

註：流程非線性，可依 v1/v2/v3 組合調整
