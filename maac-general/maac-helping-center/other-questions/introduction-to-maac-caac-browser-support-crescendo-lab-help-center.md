## Browser Support Policy

Our primary maintenance targets are the latest versions of Chrome and iOS Safari. We do not provide support for operating systems and browser versions officially discontinued by their respective vendors (for example, Windows 7/8/8.1).

While our desktop applications may function on Safari and Firefox, we recommend using Chrome as the primary browser for optimal performance.

## Chrome Support

For the best experience, we recommend using Chrome as your browser. Please ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements outlined on the official [Chrome support page](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626?hl=zh_Hant_TW).

Google's enterprise support is available only for systems meeting these minimum requirements. If Chrome is installed on systems that don’t meet these conditions, Google will not provide support.

## MAAC Browser Support

MAAC is designed for desktop environments and does not support mobile devices. The minimum Chrome version for MAAC is 110. Refer to the [Chrome support page](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626?hl=zh_Hant_TW) for more details.
