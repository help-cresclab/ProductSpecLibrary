# Country (Region)

I can convert and optimize this content for GitBook, but before I proceed I need a quick clarification so I format it the way you want.

Which output format do you prefer?

1. A cleaned 3‑column markdown table: Code | English name | Chinese name (one row per country).
   * This will keep only the core mapping and remove the extraneous empty cells and notes.
2. A grouped table that separates the APAC/target list (TW, EN, Thai, JP) and "Others" from the full ISO list (so the APAC subset is highlighted and the remaining countries are placed under "Others").
3. Keep the full original large table but cleaned of UI/navigation noise (i.e., preserving all columns and empty cells) — essentially a direct markdown reproduction.

Also: there are some rows with additional notes (rows 2–4 contain research notes and business goals). Do you want those included as separate text blocks above the table (kept verbatim) or omitted?

Tell me: which option (1/2/3) and whether to include the research/goal notes. I'll then produce the GitBook-optimized markdown (with stepper/tabs/hints if useful).
